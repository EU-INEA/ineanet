With  the  ultimate  aim  of  forming  a  multi-modal  network  that  allows  people  and  goods  to  circulate  quickly  and  easily  in  a  single  European  transport  area,  TEN-T  projects  are  also  helping  to  build  an  integrated,  greener  and  ultimately  decarbonised  European  transport  system  which  benefits  all  EU  citizens,  both  economically  and  socially.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>INEA  is  doing  its  part  by  continuing  the  efficient  and  effective  implementation  of  the  projects.  This  section  allows  you  to  experience  firsthand  how  individual  TEN-T  projects  managed  by  the  Agency  are  collectively  helping  to  complete  the  TEN-T  network  and  change  the  face  of  European  mobility.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Many  of  these  projects  are  featured  in  three  brochures  highlighting  TEN-T  implementation  successes:</p>

FABs  are  important  in  making  European  airspace  safer  and  more  efficient  and  will  prepare  it  for  the  predicted  doubling  of  air  traffic  levels  by  2020.</p> 
<p><br>In  this  framework,  ANS  providers  within  each  FAB  should  coordinate  together  to  ensure  their  airspace  is  correctly  and  efficiently  managed.  For  the  establishment  of  the  Danish  and  Swedish  FAB  and  the  integration  of  the  en-route  areas,  LFV  and  Naviair  used  the  TEN-T  co-funded  study  to  look  at  the  various  possible  business  cases  for  closer  mutual  cooperation.  When  the  study  was  completed,  they  set  up  an  interim  operational  alliance  which  paved  the  way  for  the  creation  of  NUAC  HB  in  2009,  a  subsidiary  jointly  owned  by  Naviair  and  LFV.</p> 
<p><strong><br></strong></p> 
<p><strong><br></strong></p> 
<p><strong>Benefits  of  the  project</strong><br>NUAC  HB  started  providing  operational  support  at  the  beginning  of  2011.  From  mid-2012,  NUAC  will  take  over  the  operations  of  the  three  air  traffic  control  centres  from  Naviair  and  LFV.  It  will  deliver  air  traffic  services  in  the  Danish/Swedish  FAB  —  the  first  integrated  ANS  provider  to  do  so  in  a  FAB.</p> 
<p><br>By  creating  NUAC  and  giving  it  the  responsibility  of  delivering  the  en-route  services  in  the  Danish  and  Swedish  FAB,  Naviair  and  LFV  have  managed  to  reduce  costs,  streamline  decision  making  and  ensure  that  a  professional,  efficient  ANS  service  is  delivered.  However,  the  advantages  don't  stop  here  and  are  not  only  for  the  companies  involved.  Through  the  integration  and  establishment  of  the  FAB  and  NUAC,  the  programme  can  deliver  shorter  flight  times  between  the  regional  airports,  thus  reducing  journey  times  for  travellers  and  lowering  the  environmental  impact  of  the  air  sector.</p> 
<p><br>The  completion  of  the  NUAC  programme  also  benefits  the  EU  as  a  whole,  as  it  increases  flight  capacity  within  the  airspace  block  and  ensures  that  transit  traffic  is  more  efficiently  handled.</p> 
<p><br>Concretely,  establishing  the  FAB  and  NUAC  leads  to  the  following  savings:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>5,296  fewer  flying  hours  per  year,  equalling  a  savings  of  €9,278,088</li> 
<li>52,000  tonnes  of  CO&#8322;  per  year,  or  €4,588,079  annually</li> 
<li>€21,156,056  in  airline  operator  costs</li>

<p>Specifically,  the  TEN-T  co-funded  study  looked  into  the  elements  necessary  to  prepare  for  the  construction  of  the  motorway  section,  such  as:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Ddetailed  designs</li> 
<li>Geological  documentation</li> 
<li>Environmental  analysis</li> 
<li>Road  traffic  organisation</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Following  the  study’s  successful  completion  in  December  2008,  the  work  phase  began  in  July  2009  and  the  new  section  of  motorway  is  on  target  to  open  by  mid-2012.</p> 
<p><br><strong>Benefits  of  the  project</strong><br>The  findings  of  the  study  allowed  work  to  start  on  this  very  important  section  of  the  Polish  road  network.  Modernising  the  road  transport  infrastructure  is  particularly  relevant  in  countries  such  as  Poland,  where  road  fatalities  are  still  well  above  the  EU  average.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  new  Pyrzowice  to  Maciejów  motorway  section  will  allow  road  users  to:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Reduce  their  travelling  time</li> 
<li>Enjoy  increased  safety  on  the  network  by  ensuring  all  the  most  modern  accident  prevention  and  mitigation  measures  are  included.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>The  Upper  Silesian  industrial  region  will  also  benefit  from:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Safety  improvements</li> 
<li>Elimination  of  bottlenecks  on  the  existing  road  network</li> 
<li>An  alternative  route  that  will  help  relieve  the  existing  infrastructure  from  increasing  traffic  volumes.</li> 
</ul> 
<p><br>As  well  as  bringing  benefits  to  regional  road  users,  this  section  of  motorway  also  has  an  EU-wide  importance  as  it  forms  a  key  Polish  part  of  <a  id= "PAGE112470000000645 "  title= "Priority  Project  25 "  href= "javascript:void(0); ">Priority  Project  25</a>,  the  Gdañsk-Brno/Bratislava-Vienna  motorway  axis.  This  is  an  important  road  axis  connecting  the  two  central  European  hubs  of  Vienna  and  Bratislava  with  the  Baltic  and  Scandinavian  regions  through  the  port  of  Gdañsk.  Improvements  on  this  road  network  at  the  local  level  therefore  have  a  multiplier  effect  in  creating  more  efficient  European  mobility  for  all.</p>---<h2>Info  and  links</h2>---<p><span  style= "color:  #ff9900; "><strong>Member  States  involved:</strong></span></p>

<p><br>Launched  in  January  2009,  the  SITkol  portal  —  <a  href= "http://www.sitkol.pl "  target= "_blank ">www.sitkol.pl</a>  —  combines  useful  information  on  freight  and  passenger  rail  services  in  Poland,  including:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>train  timetables</li> 
<li>scheduled  stops  on  specific  lines  and</li> 
<li>information  about  works  and  expected  delays. </li> 
</ul> 
<p>Similarly,  the  portal  can  also  be  used  as  a  travel  planning  system  from  journey  start  to  end  and  includes  the  possibility  to  book  and  pay  for  train  tickets.  SITkol  also  offers  real  time  positioning  of  specific  trains  on  the  network.</p> 
<p><br><strong>Benefits  of  the  project</strong><br>The  completion  of  the  project  has  given  Polish  citizens  and  businesses  a  unique  web  portal  to  plan  their  rail  journeys  and  track  the  progress  of  trains  across  the  network  through  interactive  maps.  This  allows  users  to  plan,  book  and  pay  for  their  train  travel  without  leaving  the  comfort  of  their  homes,  significantly  reducing  passenger  congestion  at  busy  railway  stations.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  possibility  of  ticketless  travel  offered  by  the  mobile  version  of  the  SITkol  portal  has  also  reduced  costs  for  operators  and  customers  alike  —  everyone  with  a  mobile   internet  connection  has  the  possibility  to  book  and  pay  for  a  journey  from  any  location  they  choose.</p> 
<p><br>These  advantages  have  been  reflected  in  the  increased  use  of  the  SITkol  portal:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>7.5  million  visits  and  over  4  million  unique  visitors  between  2009  and  2011</li> 
<li>Daily  visits  to  the  site:  2,000  in  2009,  25,000  today</li> 
</ul> 
<p><br>This  virtual  information  system  is  further  enhanced  by  a  railway  station  information  system  and  a  multimedia  kiosk  located  in  Warsaw  Central  station.  These  provide  users   with  direct  access  to  the  SITkol  portal  without  the  need  for  an  internet  connection.  The  kiosk  has  proved  so  popular  that  the  station’s  governing  body  has  ordered  the  installation  of  additional  ones  with  the  same  functionalities.

<li>Aramaio-Mondragón  (works  ongoing)</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Due  to  the  mountainous  landscape  of  this  region,  the  works  include  the  construction  of  a  series  of  viaducts  and  tunnels.</p> 
<p><br><strong>Benefits  of  the  project</strong><br>Once  fully  complete,  the  project  will  boost  the  competitiveness  of  rail  transport  between  Madrid  and  the  cities  located  along  the  affected  corridor  (Valladolid,  Burgos,  Vitoria,  Bilbao  and  San  Sebastián).</p> 
<p><br>The  project  also  aims  to  substantially  improve  travel  time  along  this  line  by  replacing  conventional  rail  transport  with  high  speed  trains  and  by  creating  a  faster  direct  rail  connection  between  the  cities  involved.  Once  the  entire  line  is  complete,  passengers  will  be  able  to  travel  from  Madrid  to  Bilbao  in  2h30min,  compared  with  the  current  journey  of  over  five  hours.  Safety  will  also  be  improved  through  modern  signalling  and  train  control  systems  (ERTMS).</p> 
<p><br>Local  and  regional  rail  traffic  —  both  passenger  and  freight  —  will  benefit  once  the  project  is  complete:  passengers  will  take  advantage  of  faster  travel  times,  and  business  customers  will  profit  from  the  reliability  of  the  new  infrastructure.  The  high  speed  line  will  increase  rail’s  share  from  3%  to  21%  of  the  total  trips  between  Madrid  and  the  various  cities  along  the  rail  line  in  the  Basque  Country.</p> 
<p><br>Completion  of  this  rail  section  will  also  have  a  positive  effect  on  eastwest  mobility  in  the  EU,  by  completing  one  of  the  missing  high  speed  rail  sections  needed  to  connect  Paris  to  Madrid.</p>---<h2>Info  and  links</h2>---<p><span  style= "color:  #ff9900; "><strong>Member  States  involved:</strong></span></p>

</ul> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Benefits  of  the  project</strong><br>The  installation  of  ERTMS  receivers  and  the  parallel  equipment  of  locomotives  with  ETCS  is  a  long  standing  priority  for  the  harmonisation  of  railway  traffic  management  systems  throughout  Europe.  It  allows  for  a  more  efficient  use  of  the  rail  infrastructure,  ensuring  timely  connections  between  cities  and  a  higher  level  of  safety.</p> 
<p><br>ERTMS  deployment  and  equipping  locomotives  with  ETCS  ensures  that  both  passenger  and  freight  connections  in  the  rail  sections  can  reap  the  benefits  of  the  system.  By  being  able  to  instantaneously  track  a  train&rsquo;s  progress  through  the  rail  network,  operators  are  better  able  to  manage  traffic  (towards  Rotterdam&rsquo;s  busy  port  or  the  Thalys  passenger  service)  and  hence  reduce  travel  times  and  increase  capacity.  At  the  same  time,  knowing  that  the  system  ensures  the  highest  possible  safety  levels  by  automatically  spacing  trains,  rail  traffic  can  be  safely  managed  and  operated,  resulting  in  a  more  efficient  and  environmentally  friendly  service.</p>---<h2>Info  and  links</h2>---<p><span  style= "color:  #ff9900; "><strong>Member  States  involved:</strong></span></p>

<p> <br>This  project  —  also  part  of  <a  id= "PAGE112470000000629 "  title= "Priority  Project  17 "  href= "javascript:void(0); ">Priority  Project  17</a>,  the  railway  axis  Paris-Strasbourg-Stuttgart-Wien-Bratislava  —  involves  conducting  the  design  studies,  land  acquisition,  environmental  studies  and  preparatory  works  for  a  106  km  stretch  of  the  LGV  Est  line  between  the  French  cities  of  Baudrecourt  and  Vendenheim.</p> 
<p><br>The  preparatory  design  phase  was  concluded  in  2010,  two  years  ahead  of  schedule,  and  the  construction  phase  is  currently  ongoing  and  set  to  be  completed  by  the  end  of  2012.  The  TEN-T  programme  is  also  supporting  the  construction  phase  of  the  high  speed  rail  section  to  the  tune  of  almost  €76  million  under  the  <a  id= "PAGE112470000128135 "  title= "EERP  Projects "  href= "javascript:void(0); ">European  Economic  Recovery  Plan</a>.</p> 
<p><br><strong>Benefits  of  the  project</strong><br>The  first  phase,  from  Paris  to  Baudrecourt,  was  already  completed  in  June  2007,  six  months  ahead  of  time.  The  link  from  Baudrecourt  to  Vendenheim  will  therefore  enable  the  high  speed  rail  connection  right  through  to  Germany.  Once  completed  it  will  reduce  travelling  times:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Paris-Strasbourg:  1h50min  (shortening  the  current  time  by  half  an  hour)</li> 
<li>Luxembourg-Strasbourg:  1h25min  (saving  45  minutes  on  the  current  time)</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Rail  connections  with  Germany  and  Switzerland  will  also  be  improved  thanks  to  the  new  line,  confirming  eastern  France's  place  at  the  heart  of  the  European  high  speed  railway  network.  After  completion  of  the  high  speed  network  in  Germany,  it  will  be  possible  to  travel:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Paris-Munich:  4h30min  (compared  to  8h30min  today)</li>

<td  valign= "top "><strong>Project  Description</strong><br>This  project  involved  the  creation  of  various  pilot  schemes  by  the  inland  waterway  managers  of  the  Belgian  region  of  Flanders  in  order  to  comply  with  the  EU's  RIS  (River  Information  Services)  Directive.</td>

<p> </p> 
<p>The  RIS  Directive  requires  Member  States  to  implement  information  services  to  support  the  planning  and  management  of  traffic  and  transport  operations  in  inland  waterways,  transforming  them  into  an  even  more  transparent,  reliable,  flexible  and  easy-to-access  transport  mode.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  project  specifically  included  studies  and  works  undertaken  by  the  two  Flemish  inland  waterway  managers  (Waterwegen  en  Zeekanaal  NV  and  nv  De  Scheepvaart)  and  the  sea  ports  of  Antwerp  and  Gent.  They  led  to  the  introduction  of  harmonised,  interoperable  and  publicly  accessible  Intelligent  Transport  System  (ITS)  solutions  such  as:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Electronic  Navigation  Charts  for  inland  navigation</li> 
<li>Electronic  Ship  Reporting</li> 
<li>Notices  to  skippers</li> 
<li>Tracking  and  tracing  applications</li> 
</ul> 
<p>All  were  realised  over  a  period  of  just  under  three  years.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Results  of  the  project  have  been  disseminated  by  Promotie  Binnenvaart  Vlaanderen,  the  Flemish  inland  navigation  promotion  office.</p> 
<p><br><strong>Benefits  of  the  project</strong><br>Introducing  these  various  ITS  solutions  to  the  inland  waterway  network  of  Flanders  has:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Facilitated  navigation</li> 
<li>Improved  safety</li> 
<li>Increased  the  speed  of  transfer  of  information  between  authorities  and  skippers  or  between  skippers</li> 
<li>Reduced  waiting  times  at  locks</li> 
</ul> 
<p><br>Presently,  more  than  20  inland  waterways  in  Flanders  and  the  port  of  Antwerp  area  are  covered  by  Inland  Electronic  Navigation  Charts  (IENCs)  that  were  produced  by  this  project.  These  systems  offer  significant  benefits  to  vessels  including  accurate  and  real-time  display  of  vessel  position  relative  to  waterway  features,  journey  planning  and  monitoring.  Additionally,  three  inland  AIS  (Automatic  Identification  System)  base  stations  were  installed  along  the  Flemish  waterways  as  a  pilot  under  this  project,  with  18  more  due  to  become  operational  before  the  end  of  2011.  These  base  stations  play  an  important  role  in  RIS  as  they  receive  electronic  signals  containing  information  such  as  position,  speed,  and  navigational  status  from  vessels  using  the  waterway.  The  information  received  can  then  be  displayed  on  an  onboard  screen  or  chart  plotter,  allowing  vessels  to  see  the  positions  of  waterway  users  —  much  like  with  a  radar  display.</p> 
<p><br>The  benefits  of  RIS  also  extend  beyond  easier  navigation  through  rivers  and  canals,  and  bring  positive  benefits  to  efficiency  and  the  environment.  By  being  able  to  accurately  plan  their  journeys,  skippers  are  able  to  estimate  arrival  and  waiting  times  at  locks  and  can  therefore  adapt  their  cruising  speed  accordingly,  resulting  in  less  fuel  burnt  and  lower  emissions.</p>---<h2>Info  and  links</h2>---<p><span  style= "color:  #ff9900; "><strong>Member  States  involved:</strong></span></p>

<p>A  new  dimension  of  coordination  and  cooperation  was  launched  in  2006  with  IRIS  Europe  (Implementation  of  River  Information  Services  in  Europe)  —  the  first  multinational  TEN-T  project  of  its  kind,  aimed  at  improving  RIS  across nine  EU  Member  States.  The  original  IRIS  Europe  project  was  concluded  in  December  2008,  but  the  work  now  continues  in  the  follow-up  pilot  project  IRIS  Europe  II.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  IRIS  Europe  II  project  includes  nine  EU  Member  States  and  four  cooperation  partners,  which  means  it  covers  the  width  of  Europe  from  east  to  west.  It  focuses  on  further  enhancement  and  fine-tuning  of  key  RIS  technologies,  services  and  applications,  concentrating  on  four  main  thematic  areas:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Fairway  Information  Services  (FIS):  FIS  services,  traditionally  provided  through  paper  charts  and  VHF  radio,  provide  dynamic  geographical,  hydrological  and  administrative  data  that  are  used  by  skippers  and  fleet  managers  to  plan  and  monitor  a  journey.</li> 
<li>Traffic  and  transport-related  RIS  services</li> 
<li>Technical  and  Administrative  Agreement  for  international  data  exchange</li> 
<li>Quality  of  Information  Services  for  RIS</li> 
</ul> 
<p>The  project  aims  to  significantly  contribute  to  a  harmonised  RIS  implementation  at  European  level.</p> 
<p><br><strong>Benefits  of  the  project</strong><br>The  IRIS  II  project  is  bringing  forward  the  implementation  of  RIS  services  across  Europe  as  envisaged  by  the  European  Commission’s  RIS  Directive,  adopted  in  2005.</p> 
<p><br>The  project  has  had  a  positive  effect  on  inland  waterway  navigation,  making  it  more  attractive  as  an  alternative  means  of  transporting  goods  across  Europe.  In  particular,  the  project:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Increases  the  safety  of  inland  navigation  –  accurate  positioning  of  vessels  in  canals  and  rivers  means  fewer  collisions  and  makes  it  possible  to  safely  navigate  even  in  adverse  weather  conditions,  such  as  heavy  fog.</li> 
<li>Increases  the  efficiency  of  inland  navigation  and  makes  it  more  environmentally  friendly  –  through  better  journey  planning,  operators  will  be  able  to  optimise  fuel  consumption  and  reduce  or  eliminate  waiting  times  at  locks.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Both  land  infrastructure  and  onboard  equipment  were  installed  as  part  of  the  IRIS  II  projects.  In  Slovakia,  Hungary  and  Romania  around  375  vessels  were  equipped  with  Automatic  Identification  System  (AIS)  transponders,  with  a  further  60  Romanian  vessels  being  equipped  with  electronic  chart  displays.</p> 
<p><br>Through  these  efforts,  IRIS  II  has  helped  increase  the  attractiveness  of  inland  navigation,  and  has  therefore  made  it  an  environmentally  friendly  alternative  to  the  main  transport  modes  such  as  road  and  rail.</p>---<h2>Info  and  links</h2>---<p><span  style= "color:  #ff9900; "><strong>Member  States  involved:</strong></span></p>

<p> </p> 
<p>The  port  is  one  of  the  most  modern  harbours  in  the  Baltic  region  and  is  situated  in  a  key  location  not  only  for  Swedish  exports,  but  also  for  the  import  and  distribution  of  goods  to  markets  in  Sweden,  the  Nordic  countries  and  the  Baltic  region  as  a  whole.  The  project  aimed  to:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>increase  accessibility</li> 
<li>allow  for  more  efficient  handling  of  freight  flows,  with  sustainable  transport  modes</li> 
<li>increase  competitiveness  for  local  and  regional  trade  and  industry</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Improvements  to  the  safety,  capacity  and  accessibility  of  the  port  were  made  mainly  by  increasing  the  depth  and  width  of  its  entrance  channel,  as  well  as  in  the  port  manoeuvring  and  docking  area.  The  port’s  3.8  km  long  access  fairway  was  deepened  from  12.7  to  14.9  metres  and  broadened  from  60  to  100  metres.  The  project  also  included  the  improvement  of  fairway  markings  to  facilitate  navigation  into  the  port  and  the  reinforcement  of  berths,  enabling  them  to  hold  larger  vessels.</p> 
<p><br><strong>Benefits  of  the  project</strong><br>This  project  contributes  to  safer  navigation  by  widening  the  access  to  the  port  and  therefore  allowing  larger  vessels  to  use  the  infrastructure.  Following  the  improvements,  existing  restrictions  for  darkness,  visibility  and  wind  have  been  reduced,  allowing  for  24-hour  access  to  the  port  for  vessels  of  a  size  of  260  x  35  x  13.5  metres.</p> 
<p><br>This  specific  project  also  forms  part  of  the  Norrköping  Intermodal  Infrastructure  Package,  a  long-term  project  aiming  at  further  developing  Norrköping  as  an  intermodal  node  capable  of  shifting  goods  from  sea  to  rail/road  and  vice-versa,  increasing  the  competitiveness  of  the  region  and  boosting  its  capacity  to  attract  commercial  traffic.  Thus,  the  improvements  made  will  also  lead  to  increased  intermodality  in  the  future.</p> 
<p><br>Furthermore,  the  port  is  located  on  TEN-T  <a  id= "PAGE112470000000619 "  title= "Priority  Project  12 "  href= "javascript:void(0); ">Priority  Project  12</a>  (the   "Nordic  Triangle ")  that  links  the  Nordic  countries  and  their  capital  cities  to  each  other  and  improves  connections  to  central  Europe  and  between  the  EU  and  Russia.  The  city  of  Norrköping  and  its  port  have  been  identified  by  the  Swedish  transport  administration  as  one  of  the  key  intermodal  nodes  in  Sweden  within  the  Nordic  Triangle  corridor,  and  this  will  help  to  ensure  international  traffic  flows  and  the  viability  of  the  TEN-T  network  in  this  region.</p>---<h2>Info  and  links</h2>---<p><span  style= "color:  #ff9900; "><strong>Member  States  involved:</strong></span></p>

<p>The  following  ITS  applications  were  installed:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Incident  detection  and  automatic  signing,  traffic  detection  system  and  queue  protection  using  variable  message  signs  on  cantilever  structures</li> 
<li>Strategic  diversionary  message  sign  information  at  specific  junctions</li> 
<li>Extensive  closed  circuit  television  (CCTV)  coverage  for  improved  incident  response</li> 
</ul> 
<p><br><strong>Benefits  of  the  project</strong><br>The  extensive  ITS  applications  on  this  stretch  of  infrastructure  have  allowed  the  road  network  operator  to  gather  real-time  information  regarding  traffic  flows,  possible  bottlenecks  and  accidents.  Road  users  have  benefited  from  increased  levels  of  safety  and  have  utilised  real-time  traffic  information  for  better  journey  planning  and  alternative  route  suggestions.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Research  has  shown  that  queue  protection  systems  significantly  reduce  the  risk  of  rear-end  accidents,  saving  an  average  of  13%  of  all  injury  accidents  on  the  affected  network.  Additionally,  CCTV  coverage  has  lowered  incident  response  time  and  shortens  the  duration  of  accidents,  giving  in  turn  a  2%  reduction  in  the  severity<br>of  casualties.</p> 
<p><br>Through  the  use  of  ITS,  the  project  has:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Helped  to  remove  bottlenecks  for  both  national  and  international  traffic</li> 
<li>Improved  interconnections  with  ports  and  airports</li> 
<li>Increased  capacity</li> 
<li>Improved  safety  and  throughput  of  traffic,  particularly  the  traffic  travelling  to  and  from  the  ports  of  Felixstowe  and  Harwich  connecting  to  Europe</li> 
<li>minimised  any  adverse  environmental  impact  by  using  detection  technology  rather  than  carriageway  widening</li>

<p><strong>Project  Description</strong></p> 
<p>The  João  Paulo  II  airport  on  the  Azores  island  of  São  Miguel  (Portugal)  is  a  regional  hub  connecting  the  other  islands  of  the  archipelago  to  mainland  Portugal  and  Europe.</p>

<p>The  project  set  out  to  eliminate  a  bottleneck  which  limited  the  flow  of  passengers  to  the  region.  By  allowing  airport  capacity  to  be  increased  and  consequently  eliminate  the  growing  degradation  in  service  quality  in  peak  demand  period,  the  project  benefitted  the  entire  ultra-peripheral  area  of  the  Azores.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  activities  consisted  of:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Expanding  the  air  terminal's  boarding  area</li> 
<li>Enlarging  the  airport's  apron</li> 
<li>Building  new  taxiways</li> 
<li>Upgrading  the  airfield's  ground  lighting  system,  command  and  control  system  and  air-side  electrical  vaults</li> 
</ul> 
<p>The  main  objectives  of  the  action  were  to:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>eliminate  the  existing  bottleneck  of  departures  during  peak  hours  and  meet  demand  targets  in  order  to  encourage  further  tourism</li> 
<li>contribute  to  a  sustainable  socio-economic  growth  of  the  archipelago  by  increasing  air  traffic  from  adjacent  islands  as  well  as  from  mainland  Europe  and  the  rest  of  the  world</li> 
<li>increase  safety  conditions  and  shortening  time  delays  by  building  a  new  taxiway</li> 
</ul> 
<p>The  increase  in  aircraft  parking  capacity  in  the  new  apron  could  also  make  the  future  construction  of  a  logistical  platform  feasible,  thus  allowing  the  airport  to  profit  from  the  air  cargo  business  and  the  interconnection  with  the  port  of  Ponta  Delgada  on  the  same  island.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p><strong>Benefits  of  the  Project</strong></p> 
<p>Expanding  the  infrastructure  at  João  Paulo  II  airport  has  brought  many  benefits,  including:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Elimination  of  the  peak  time  departures  bottleneck</li> 
<li>Improved  passenger  service  quality</li> 
<li>Reduced  waiting  times  for  passengers  at  security  control</li> 
<li>Increased  space  and  comfort  levels  inside  the  departures  terminal.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>For  airlines,  this  means  reduced  time  intervals  between  unloading  and  boarding,  making  their  fleets  more  profitable.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  passenger  processing  capacity  in  departures  has  increased  by  approximately  200  passengers  per  hour  since  the  expansion,  allowing  800  passengers  per  hour  to  pass  through  the  departure  terminal  during  peak  periods.  This  is  mostly  due  to:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Adding  seven  extra  boarding  gates  which  can  operate  simultaneously</li> 
<li>Enlargement  of  the  departure  lounges  to  accommodate  more  passengers</li> 
<li>Adding  two  more  security  channels  (x-ray),  doubling  the  previous  capacity</li> 
</ul> 
<p>The  new  taxiways  make  landings/take-offs  at  the  airport  safer  and  more  efficient  and  the  apron  that  has  been  extended  next  to  the  terminal  has  made  the  turnaround  of  aircraft  faster  and  less  expensive,  thereby  also  reducing  their  impact  on  the  environment.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>As  a  result  of  the  project,  the  airport  has  improved  its  role  as  a  regional  hub,  with  better  daily  links  to  the  eight  other  Azores  islands  and  better  connecting  the  archipelago  to  mainland  Portugal,  Europe  and  the  rest  of  the  world.  Consequently,  the  airport’s  expansion  is  expected  to  result  in  increased  tourism  to  the  region.</p>---<h2>Info  and  links</h2>---<p><span  style= "color:  #ff9900; "><strong>Member  States  involved:</strong></span></p>

<p><strong>The  project</strong></p> 
<p>The  Nete  river  railway  bridges  form  a  key  section  of  the  high  speed  line  between  Brussels  and  Antwerp,  crossing  over  an  important  inland  waterway  and  continuing  on  into  the  Netherlands.</p> 
</td> 
</tr> 
</tbody> 
</table> 
<p> </p> 
<p>However,  as  the  bridges  were  unsuitable  for  high  speed  rail  travel  (up  to  160  km/h),  the  decision  was  taken  to  build  a  new  bridge  and  improve  an  existing  one.  As  part  of  their  overall  plan  to  improve  inland  shipping  in  the  area  and  remove  key  bottlenecks,  Waterwegen  en  Zeekanaal  NV,  the  Flemish  waterway  authority,  requested  the  new  bridge  to  be  constructed  at  a  height  that  would  ensure  a  clearance  of  7  m  and  the  second  bridge  to  be  raised  to  the  same  level.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>This  project  contained  the  most  important  activities  of  the  first  phase  of  the  works.  The  activities  included  were:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>construction  of  a  supporting  wall  at  Duffel  on  line  25</li> 
<li>construction  of  the  second  supporting  wall  and  the  road  construction  at  Duffel  on  line  25</li> 
<li>structural  works  on  the  new  railway  bridge  over  the  Nete  on  line  27</li> 
<li>railway,  overhead  wire  and  signal  works  for  the  construction  of  the  provisional  lines  between  the  Duffel  railway  station  and  the  Nete  bridges</li> 
</ul> 
<p> </p> 
<p><strong>Benefits  of  the  project</strong></p> 
<p>By  raising  these  bridges,  Waterwegen  en  Zeekanaal  NV  wants  to  further  promote  inland  shipping  in  this  area,  in  order  to  allow  vessels  with  a  higher  level  of  containers  to  pass  along  the  waterway.  This  would  result  in  a  better  economic  return  and  help  to  make  inland  shipping  more  competitive  in  relation  to  road  transport.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Raising  the  bridges  over  the  Nete  is  the  only  action  required  to  upgrade  this  river  to  a  class  Va  waterway  and  no  works  have  to  be  carried  out  on  the  river  itself.  With  the  raising  of  the  two  bridges,  only  two  further  barriers  remain  to  attain  sufficient  clearance  height  on  the  entire  waterway  line.  Waterwegen  en  Zeekanaal  NV  has  already  started  a  first  feasibility  study  to  examine  the  raising  of  these  obstacles:  the  road  bridges  at  Walem  and  Duffel.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>In  the  long  run,  once  these  two  remaining  road  bridges  are  replaced,  the  Beneden-Nete  section  and  the  Netekanaal  will  be  navigable  for  ships  up  to  2,000  tonnes  and/or  carrying  three  levels  of  containers.  This  is  important  as  it  creates  an  alternative  shipping  route  between  the  Schelde  river  and  the  Albertkanaal,  avoiding  the  port  of  Antwerp,  as  well  as  between  the  Albertkanaal  and  the  port  of  Antwerp,  in  case  of  an  obstruction,  thus  improving  the  network’s  reliability.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  overall  project  facilitates  inland  shipping  in  the  area,  by  allowing  a  higher  level  of  containers,  and  therefore  a  better  economic  return,  and  improving  the  reliability  of  the  network.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  old  railway  bridge  will  be  demolished  at  the  end  of  the  overall  project  in  2013.  Together  with  the  raising  of  the  road  bridges  in  Walem  and  Duffel,  this  will  lead  to  the  upgrade  of  the  entire  waterway,  and  thus  promote  sustainable  transport  in  the  region.</p>---<h2>Info  and  links</h2>---<p><span  style= "color:  #ff9900; "><strong>Member  States  involved:</strong></span></p>

<p>It  is  also  the  main  north  European  transit  hub  for  distribution  of  new  cars  for  the  Nordic  market  and  the  countries  around  the  Baltic  Sea,  and  is  an  important  link  for  the  roll-on,  roll-off  (ro-ro)  ferry  system  for  heavy  goods  vehicles.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  old  port  lacked  the  space  needed  for  expansion  with  regard  to  ro-ro,  new  cars  and  container  terminal  facilities,  and  therefore  the  port  is  in  the  process  of  expanding  into  a  new  area  in  order  to  fulfil  its  long  term  needs.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  aim  of  this  project  was  to  overcome  infrastructure  bottlenecks  and  increase  capacity  for  ro-ro  containers,  cars  and  multimodal  distribution  services  (ship,  train,  truck).  New  connected  ro-ro,  container  and  combi  terminals  are  being  built  in  Norra  Hamnen,  neighbouring  a  planned  new  distribution  centre.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>This  action  concerned  not  only  the  construction  of  a  50,000m2  consolidated  terminal  area  for  containers  and  trailers  but  also  the  construction  of  two  800m  railway  lines  and  two  switches  in  the  terminal  area.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p><strong>Benefits  of  the  project</strong></p> 
<p>The  first  stage  for  Norra  Hamnen  harbour  started  in  spring  2009  when  construction  got  underway  for:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Three  new  ferry  berths  for  ro-ro  traffic</li> 
<li>The  new  container  dock</li> 
<li>New  combi-terminal.  Today  all  these  investments  have  been  completed.  The  new  terminals  enable  the  port  to  handle  five  times  as  much  freight  as  it  did  before.</li>

<p>Linking  sea,  rail  and  lorry  traffic  in  at  Norra  Hamnen  makes  the  handling  of  goods  quicker  and  more  cost-effective.  The  transfer  of  freight  transport  from  the  roads  to  the  railways  and  sea  is  also  an  important  element  of  the  EU’s  vision  for  an  efficient  and  long-term  sustainable  transport  system.  The  new  terminals  are  predicted  to  provide  huge  time  savings  –  for  example,  once  Norra  Hamnen  is  complete  the  time  in  port  per  vessel  should  be  reduced  by  20  minutes,  on  average.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  transport  distance  for  lorries  will  also  be  reduced,  making  driving  from  the  motorway  network  around  15  minutes  quicker.  The  environmental  benefits  are  also  clear:  once  the  terminals  have  been  moved  to  Norra  Hamnen,  both  ferry  and  lorry  traffic  will  be  further  away  from  the  city  centre  of  Malmö,  resulting  in  lower  emissions  and  less  traffic  in  the  city  centre.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Train  traffic  is  connected  to  Norra  Hamnen  via  the  new  combi-terminal,  where  the  track  facility  allows  freight  to  be  loaded  and  unloaded,  including  a  600  m  connecting  track  and  two  800  m  loading  and  unloading  tracks  that  are  intended  to  handle  the  entire  train  set.  These  new  facilities  should  result  in  an  increase  in  combi-traffic.  In  the  long  term,  around  30-40%  of  trailers  and  containers  in  Norra  Hamnen  will  arrive  or  depart  by  rail.</p>---<h2>Info  and  links</h2>---<p><span  style= "color:  #ff9900; "><strong>Member  States  involved:</strong></span></p>

<p>The  aim  of  the  project  was  to  reconstruct  the  double-line  electrified  railway  section  between  Breclav  and  the  border  with  Slovakia  (10.4  km)  in  order  improve  safety,  capacity  and  speed  on  the  line.  The  activities  included:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>renovation  of  the  railway  substructure  and  superstructure:  traction  lines,  overhead  contact  system,  new  over-crossings,  interlocking  systems,  security  installations,  communication  systems,  heavy-current  distribution  lines</li> 
<li>reconstruction  of  old  railroad  bridges  and  the  construction  of  a  new  bridge</li> 
<li>renovation  of  the  transformation,  feeding,  and  switching  station  in  Breclav,  improving  the  current  traction  power  station  technology</li> 
<li>building  of  new  elevated  platforms,  including  an  isle-type  elevated  platform  in  Lanzhot,  accessible  via  the  subway  station</li> 
<li>construction  of  anti-noise  walls</li> 
</ul> 
<p><strong>Benefits  of  the  project</strong></p> 
<p>The  renovation  works  improved  the  capacity  and  speed  of  the  line  for  both  passenger  and  cargo  transport.  Improvements  the  line  mean  that  trains  can  now  travel  at  speeds  up  to  160  km/h.</p>

<p>The  project  concerns  the  construction  of  phase  1  of  the  branch,  which  involves  building  140km  of  new  high  speed  railway  line  between  Villers-Les-Pots  (near  Dijon)  and  Petit-Croix  (near  Belfort).  The  works  involved  in  the  project  include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>13  viaducts  –  one  of  which  will  span  1,340  m</li> 
<li>160  bridges</li> 
<li>a  2  km  tunnel</li> 
<li>Two  brand  new  railway  stations  –  Bescançon  Franche  Comté  TGV  and  Belfort-Montbélliard  TGV.</li> 
</ul> 
<p><strong>Benefits  of  the  project</strong></p> 
<p>The  line  will  allow  a  faster  connection  for  passengers  between  Dijon  and  major  eastern  French  cities  such  as  Strasbourg  and  Mulhouse,  as  well  as  providing  a  faster  rail  connection  into  Switzerland.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  new  high  speed  line  will  result  in  significant  time  savings  for  passengers:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Dijon-Strasbourg:  +/-  2  hours  (compared  with  3h40min  today)</li> 
<li>Dijon-Mulhouse:  1h05min  (a  saving  of  1h35min)</li> 
<li>Dijon-Zurich:  2h25min  (compared  with  over  4  hours  today)</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Further  time  savings  are  expected  once  phase  2  of  the  project  is  completed.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  Rhine-Rhône  high  speed  line  is  the  seventh  high  speed  TGV  line  in  the  French  network.  Its  opening  to  commercial  traffic  in  mid-December  2011  will  have  a  significant  impact  on  a  large  number  of  other  train  routes  in  France,  directly  benefitting  12  out  of  the  21  French  regions.  By  shortening  the  distances  between  economic  and  urban  centres  along  the  Rhine  and  Rhône,  such  as  Rotterdam,  Frankfurt  and  Lyon,  the  line  will  also  boost  mobility  in  the  regions  it  serves  and  will  therefore  help  to  develop  economic  activity  and  tourism.  Around  12  million  passengers  per  year  are  expected  to  use  the  line  once  it  is  up  and  running.</p>---<h2>Info  and  links</h2>---<p><span  style= "color:  #ff9900; "><strong>Member  States  involved:</strong></span></p>

<p><strong>Description  of  the  project</strong></p> 
<p>The  Grand  Port  Maritime  de  Dunkirk  is  the  largest  French  port  in  the  North  Sea  and  the  third  biggest  port  in  France  in  terms  of  cargo  turnover.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  port  experiences  long  queues  during  rush  hour  between  the  short  sea  terminal,  dubbed   "Terminal  Roulier ",  and  the  E40  highway.  Truck  traffic  generated  by  the  Roll  On-Roll  Off  ferry  between  Dunkirk  and  Dover  merges  into  a  road  already  experiencing  intense  urban  traffic  due  to  two  roundabouts  and  a  railway  crossing.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  objectives  of  the  project  supported  by  the TEN-T  Programme are:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>optimise  port  accessibility</li> 
<li>increase  safety</li> 
<li>reduce  emissions</li> 
<li>develop  sustainable  and  efficient  traffic  management  by  separating  local  traffic  from  truck  traffic</li> 
</ul> 
<p>These  objectives  will  be  achieved  via  the  construction  of  a  new  road  junction,  a  bridge  over  the  railway  line  and  the  installation  of  a  new  and  improved  traffic  sign  system.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p><strong>Benefits  of  the  Project</strong></p> 
<p>Since  completion  of  the  project,  traffic  levels  in  and  around  the  short  sea  terminal  of  the  Port  of  Dunkirk  have  significantly  improved,  leading  to  improved  transit  times  to  and  from  the  port.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>With  the  previous  road  configuration,  long  queues  of  trucks  would  form  during  peak  hours  at  the  port's  exit.  These  queues  could  often  be  2  km  long  and  it  would  take  a  vehicle  an  average  of  45  minutes  to  cover  the  distance  between  ferry  terminal  to  the  E40  motorway  (7  km).</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Upon  completion  of  the  works,  traffic  to  and  from  the  ferry  terminal  has  significantly  improved,  with  queues  all  but  disappearing  and  a  new  average  driving  time  from  terminal  to  E40  of  only  10  minutes  during  peak  hours.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  improved  accessibility  of  the  port  will  help  it  to  be  able  to  accommodate  further  traffic  volume  increases  in  the  future,  thus  allowing  this  key  infrastructure  node  to  be  even  more  important  for  France's  and  Europe's  transport  network.  Furthermore,  the  population  living  close  to  the  port  and  around  Dunkirk  will  also  benefit  from  reduced  levels  of  traffic,  noise  and  emissions  of  pollutants  from  vehicles.</p>---<h2>Info  and  links</h2>---<p><span  style= "color:  #ff9900; "><strong>Member  States  involved:</strong></span></p>

<p><strong>Description  of  the  Project</strong></p> 
<p>The  project  involves  completing  a  rail  section  linking  Brussels  Zaventem  Airport  with  the  existing  Brussels-Antwerp-Amsterdam  and  Paris-Brussels-Köln-Amsterdam-London  high-speed  rail  networks,  also  known  as  TEN-T  Priority  Project  2.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  new  link  will  allow  high  speed  trains  to  stop  at  the  airport  on  their  way  to  Brussels  or  Antwerp,  giving  passengers  more  flexibility  in  their  travel  choices  and  improving  connections  between  rail  and  air  transport.  The  project,  called  Diabolo,  has  received  almost  €9.7  million  in  EU  co-financing  to  date.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>EU  co-financing  specifically  supported:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>All  studies  related  to  the  implementation  of  the  project  (environment,  topography,  cartography,  special  technologies,  design,  planning  permissions,  building  licenses,  etc.)</li> 
<li>Works  for  construction  of  the  new  railway  and  its  connection  to  the  existing  network</li> 
<li>Land  acquisition</li> 
<li>Insurance  and  field  supervision</li> 
</ul> 
<p>The  connection  to  Brussels  airport  was  inaugurated  on  7  June  2012,  whilst  further  works  on  the  line  will  continue  until  2015.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p><strong>Benefits  of  the  Project</strong></p> 
<p>The  airport  used  to  be  only  accessible  by  a  dead-end  railway  station  served  by  local  and  regional  trains,  or  by  very  busy  road.  The  completion  of  the  link  to  Brussels  Airport  further  enhances  Europe's  network  of  high  speed  railway  lines  and  the  creation  of  an  interoperable  and  continuous  rail  network.  Passengers  will  be  able  to  seamlessly  switch  from  high  speed  rail  to  air  transport,  boosting  co-modality  even  further.  It  will  also  help  reduce  the  isolation  of  the  airport  by  improving  accessibility  and  reducing  congestion.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>This  project  contributes  to  the  interconnection  of  high  speed  lines  and  the  establishment  of  an  interoperable  rail  network,  while  reducing  the  isolation  of  Zaventem  Airport,  a  major  economic  hub  threatened  by  problems  of  accessibility  and  congestion.</p>---<h2>Info  and  links</h2>---<p><span  style= "color:  #ff9900; "><strong>Member  States  involved:</strong></span></p>

<p>Its  main  objective  is  to  design  and  demonstrate  a  set  of  prototypes  that  will  improve  the  operational  coordination  of  transport  flows  inside  ports  and  also  between  them,  facilitating  the  coordination  between  the  various  administrative  services  and  operators  at  port  level.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>During  the  project's  life,  various  successful  solutions  were  tested  in  each  of  the  4  areas  of  intervention,  namely:</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p><em><strong>Port  Level  Initiatives:</strong></em></p> 
<ul> 
<li>The  basic  structure  and  two  prototypes  for  the  creation  of  a  port  community  system  in  the  Port  of  Piraeus.</li> 
<li>Prototyping  and testing  export  paperless  controls  at  the  ports  of  Livorno,  Barcelona  and  Valencia.</li> 
<li>Testing an  automatic  gate  system  for  intra-EU  roll  on-roll  off  (ro-ro)  vessel  traffic  at  the  Port  of  Valencia.</li> 
</ul> 
<p><strong><em>Port  to  Port  Initiatives:</em></strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>A  prototype  of  system  providing  real  time  automatically-generated  information  about  the  status  of  a  vessel  to  inland  transport  operators  using  MoS  services.</li> 
<li>Testing  of  a  system  optimising  the  tracing  of  containers  and  the  documentation  associated  to  the  container  operations  at  the  ports  of  Livorno,  Koper  and  Valencia.</li> 
<li>Traceability  of  ro-ro  units  between  Spain  and  Italy.</li> 
<li>Testing  new  procedures  to  make  intra-EU  sea  transport  simpler  and  less  cumbersome  for  its  users.</li> 
</ul> 
<p><em><strong>Port  to  Hinterland  Initiatives:</strong></em></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Prototyping  and testing  of  a  rail  transport  management  system  to  better  manage  the  supply  chain  of  a  MoS  corridor.</li> 
<li>Defining  and  testing  new  common  procedures  and  electronic  messages  to  improve  communication  flows  and  create  paperless  documentation  flows.</li> 
</ul> 
<p><em><strong>Door  to  Door  Initiatives:</strong></em></p> 
<ul> 
<li>A  piloted  prototype  for  an  interoperable  paperless  import/export  process  along  a  MoS  door  to  door  corridor  for  full  container  load  (FCL)  shipments.</li> 
<li>A  traceability  prototype  system  for  automotive  logistics  using  electronic  data  interchange.</li> 
<li>The  creation  of  a  network  of  short-sea  consolidation  centres,  offering  specialised  services  for  intra-EU  traffic.</li> 
</ul> 
<p> </p> 
<p><strong>Benefits  of  the  project</strong></p> 
<p>Thanks  to  these  abovementioned  results,  MOS4MOS  contributes  to  addressing  important  EU  policy  objectives  such  as  establishing  major  interoperable  transport  corridors  interconnecting  Spanish,  Italian,  Slovenian  and  Greek  national  networks  and  facilitating  the  functioning  of  the  internal  market.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  project  promotes  the  optimal  use  of  existing  infrastructure  capacities  and  the  technological  solutions  proposed  are  set  to  improve  the  safety  and  reliability  of  the  transport  network,  enhancing  accessibility  to  various  peripheral  regions  within  the  EU  and  facilitating  congestion  relief  on  road  infrastructure.  The  project  is  very  much  aligned  with  EU  policy  as  it  aims  to  improve  and  promote  MoS  corridors  that  will  contribute  to  balancing  the  European  modal  split,  reducing  CO2  emissions  and  thus  contributing  to  addressing  climate  change.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  Cost  Benefit  Analysis  (CBA)  of  the  forthcoming  implementation  of  the  15  initiatives  included  in  the  project  (carried  out  as  part  of  Activity  1  and  updated  using  the  piloting  results  in  May  2012)  shows  that,  even  using  very  conservative  hypotheses  and  assuming  the  implementation  of  these  initiatives  only  in  the  port  communities  participating  in  the  project,  the  net  present  value  of  putting  into  practice  the  MOS4MOS  solutions  instead  of  continuing  using  the  current  combination  of  procedures  and  practices  is  over  €20.5  million.</p>---<h2>Info  and  links</h2>---<p><span  style= "color:  #ff9900; "><strong>Member  States  involved:</strong></span></p>

<p><strong>Description  of  the  Project</strong></p> 
<p>This  project  is  situated  on  the  Vienna-Salzburg  section  of  Priority  Project  17  (Railway  axis  Paris-Strasbourg-Stuttgart-Wien-Bratislava)  and  involves  conducting  works  to  upgrade  the  Melk  train  station.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  railway  station  was  rebuilt  and  modernised,  including  the  adjacent  service  area  for  local  busses.  Two  barrier-free  roofed  and  extended  platforms  were  built,  equipped  with  two  elevators  as  well  as  an  underground  passage  linking  the  platforms.  The  pre-existing  steel  passenger  bridge  was  removed  and  noise  protection  barriers  were  erected.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  project  also  included  works  on  the  track  bed  to  realign  the  tracks  to  allow  a  maximum  speed  of  120  km/h  for  trains  transiting  through  the  station  as  well  as  a  new  rail  junction  in  Loosdorf,  west  of  the  station,  replacing  the  switch  connection  of  the  old  tracks.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p><strong>Benefits  of  the  Project</strong></p> 
<p>The  new  Melk  station  now  allows  for  a  speed  of  120  km/h  for  transiting  trains,  meaning  a  better  performance  in  terms  of  a  higher  overall  average  speed  along  Priority  Project  17,  a  vital  west-east  link  crossing  very  densely  populated  areas  in  the  centre  of  Europe.  However,  the  global  objective  is  still  to  reach  maximum  speeds  of  up  to  200  and  250  km/h  outside  train  stations  and  urban  environments.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Refurbishing  the  station  also  means  that  it  is  now  much  more  easily  accessible  for  people  with  reduced  mobility  and  an  altogether  better  experience  for  all  kinds  of  passengers.  The  readjusted  area  for  local  bus  services  helps  users  to  benefit  from  co-modality,  contributing  to  the  reduction  of  road  traffic  and  pollution  on  the  routes  used  by  commuters  to  and  from  Melk  train  station.</p>---<h2>Info  and  links</h2>---<p><span  style= "color:  #ff9900; "><strong>Member  States  involved:</strong></span></p>

<p><strong>Project  Description</strong></p> 
<p>This  project,  which  is  part  of  the  Vienna-Salzburg  section  of  the  Railway  axis  Paris-Strasbourg-Stuttgart-Wien-Bratislava  (Priority  Project  17),  concerned  the  construction  of  a  new  rail  tunnel  (dubbed  the   "Burgstaller  tunnel ")  between  the  towns  of  Hubertendorf  and  Blindenmarkt  in  Austria.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  2  km  long  Burgstaller  tunnel  represents  part  of  the  modernisation  of  the  rail  section  going  from  Ybbs  to  Amstetten  to  bring  the  total  number  of  rail  tracks  to  4  and  thus  increase  both  capacity  as  well  as  speed.  The  tunnel  will  ultimately  contribute  to  relieve  the  existing  bottleneck  and  bridge  the  gap  between  upgraded  and  not  yet  upgraded  sub-sections.  The  new  tunnel  starts  in  Hubertendorf,  crossing  underground  the  existing  two-track  railway  line  and  the  motorway  before  re-emerging  in  the  town  of  Blindenmarkt,  where  the  new  tracks  run  parallel  to  the  existing  ones.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  EU  supported  the  construction  of  400  metres  of  the  overall  tunnel,  which  were  realised  using  different  tunnelling  techniques  (boring,  cut  and  cover  and  vessel)  by  the  beneficiary,  to  the  tune  of  almost  €3.5  million.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p><strong>Benefits  of  the  Project</strong></p> 
<p>Although  the  tunnel  is  not  yet  operational,  once  the  entire  Ybbs  to  Amstetten  section  will  be  completed  there  will  be  considerable  improvements  to  the  frequency  and  capacity  of  trains.  Currently,  in  fact,  maximum  capacity  over  the  Ybbs  to  Amstetten  section  is  302  trains  per  day,  with  a  maximum  speed  of  200  km/h.  When  the  works  will  be  finished  and  the  section  put  into  service,  the  number  of  daily  trains  will  increase  to  458  and  the  maximum  speed  to  250  km/h.   Additionally,  doubling  of  the  track  will  mean  that  freight  and  passenger  trains  will  travel  separately  rather  than  having  to  share  a  single  track  per  travel  direction,  resulting  in  better  efficiency  and  travel  times.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>With  the  section  completed  sufficient  rail  transport  capacity  will  be  created  to  meet  the  growing  demand  in  the  freight  transit  between  Germany  and  Eastern  Europe  following  the  EU  enlargement,  supporting  an  increased  shift  of  freight  traffic  from  road  to  rail  and  a  reduction  of  noise  pollution  in  an  infrastructure  which  includes  the  latest  safety  and  signalling  systems.</p>---<h2>Info  and  links</h2>---<p><span  style= "color:  #ff9900; "><strong>Member  States  involved:</strong></span></p>

<p><strong>Project  description</strong></p> 
<p>The  Port  of  Venice  is  one  of  the  busiest  commercial  and  passenger  ports  on  the  Adriatic  Sea.  Its  rail  terminal,  located  at  the  centre  of  the  port,  represents  the  focal  point  to  shift  freight  between  maritime  vessels  and  rail  convoys,  ensuring  an  efficient  and  seamless  co-modality  chain.</p> 
</td>

<p> </p> 
<p>The  project  aimed  to  restructure  and  strengthen  the  Port’s  railway  facilities.  It  concretely  supported  the  development  of  new  areas  and  facilities  for  freight  trains  as  well  as  a  more  interoperable  railway  system.  In  general,  seven  additional  parallel  railway  tracks,  totalling  4  km,  were  constructed  –  including  three  fully  electrified  tracks  (±1,500  m)  used  to  load  and  unload  rolling  stock  onto  vessels.  Additional  works  to  benefit  the  Port’s  overall  infrastructure  included  extending  the  anti-fire  systems  in  place  and  the  rainwater  collection  and  drainage  system,  as  well  as  constructing  a  local  road  to  facilitate  access  for  Port  staff.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p><strong>Benefits  of  the  project</strong></p> 
<p>Thanks  to  the  project,  the  rail  terminal  is  now  capable  of  handling  up  to  50  trains  per  day,  each  up  to  700  metres  in  length  –  a  key  factor  which  has  allowed  the  rail  freight  operator  to  establish  new  rail  links  between  the  Port  of  Venice  and  the  Padua  and  Verona  freight  villages  in  the  region.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Since  September  2012,  a  regular  service  of  three  weekly  freight  trains  to  Padua  and  one  to  Verona  are  in  operation.  This,  in  conjunction  with  the  parallel  deepening  of  the  Port  canals  for  larger  container  ships,  has  resulted  in  the  Port  doubling  its  rail  forwarding  capacity,  i.e.  roughly  12,800  tonnes  of  freight.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Completion  of  the  project  has  improved  the  entire  logistics  chain  at  the  local,  national  and  European  levels  thanks  to  the  higher  capacity  for  freight  that  the  Port  of  Venice  is  can  effectively  manage.  As  the  Port  is  now  capable  of  handling  a  higher  number  of  containers,  a  modal  shift  from  road  has  occurred,  resulting  in  fewer  overall  vehicle  emissions  and  less  harm  to  the  environment  in  the  Venice  region.</p>---<h2>Info  and  links</h2>---<p><span  style= "color:  #ff9900; "><strong>Member  States  involved:</strong></span></p>

<p><strong>Project  description</strong></p> 
<p  style= "text-align:  justify; ">The  European  Rail  Traffic  Management  System  (ERTMS)  is  a  train  control  system  designed  to  gradually  replace  the  existing  incompatible  national  signalling  systems  throughout  Europe.  Technically  composed  of  two  elements  —  a  unique  European  Train  Control  System  (ETCS)  and  a  radio  system  GSM-R  —  ERTMS  and  its  implementation  is  supported  by  the  EU  according  to  a  defined  ERTMS  European  Deployment  Plan.</p> 
<p  style= "text-align:  justify; "> </p> 
<p  style= "text-align:  justify; ">This  project  aimed  to  achieve  railway  interoperability  on  a  significant  section  of  ERTMS  Corridor  E  located  between  Austria  and  Romania  —  about  two-thirds  of  the  total  length  of  the  corridor  connecting  southeast  Europe  to  the  heart  of  the  EU.</p> 
<p  style= "text-align:  justify; "> </p> 
<p  style= "text-align:  justify; ">ETCS  onboard  units  are  a  requisite  to  enhance  ERTMS  operations.  This  project  equipped  a  total  of  97  type  1116  locomotives  with  ETCS  (SRS  2.3.0.d)  onboard  units.  The  technical  specifications  and  contractual  tasks  were  already  completed  in  2009  and  two  prototype  locomotives  were  equipped  in  March  2011.  The  retrofitting  of  97  locomotives  was  successfully  completed,  and  the  authorisation  for  ETCS  operation  was  completed  in  2013.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p><strong>Benefits  of  the  project</strong></p> 
<p  style= "text-align:  justify; ">The  use  of  ERTMS  receivers  and  the  parallel  equipping  of  locomotives  with  ETCS  is  a  key  priority  for  the  harmonisation  of  European  railway  traffic  management  systems.  A  more  efficient  use  of  the  rail  infrastructure  is  the  result,  including  timely  connections  between  cities  and  higher  standards  of  safety.  For  the  project's  implementing  body,  ÖBB,  the  equipment  of  vehicles  with  ERTMS  was  essential  because  of  the  large  amount  of  cargo  transport  it  handles  –  in  particular  to  Hungary,  Czech  Republic,  Romania  as  well  as  Bulgaria.  This  section  of  Corridor  E  between  Austria  and  Romania  can  be  operated  with  a  modern  double-system  locomotive,  including  type  1116.</p> 
<p  style= "text-align:  justify; "> </p> 
<p  style= "text-align:  justify; ">ETCS  now  makes  the  change  of  locomotives  at  each  border-crossing  obsolete.  This  supports  more  seamless  and  efficient  rail  operations,  as  well  as  guarantees  a  consistent  level  of  safety  in  cargo  train  operations.  In  addition,  because  of  the  harmonised  standards,  after  the  migration  only  one  Command  Control  Signalling  System  is  needed  for  operations  along  the  Corridor.  The  various  different  Class  B  (national)  systems  necessary  today  will  be  entirely  replaced  by  ERTMS.  Thanks  to  the  successful  deployment  of  ERTMS  along  Corridor  E,  the  project  has  contributed  to  the  increased  interoperability  of  the  TEN-T  railway  network  at  both  the  regional  and  pan-European  levels.</p>---<h2>Info  and  links</h2>---<p><span  style= "color:  #ff9900; "><strong>Member  States  involved:</strong></span></p>

<p  style= "text-align:  justify; ">Warsaw's  Frederic  Chopin  Airport  is  Poland's  largest  airport,  with  more  than  140,000  passenger  aircraft  movements  annually  and  9.5  million  passengers  in  2012.</p> 
<p  style= "text-align:  justify; "> </p> 
<p  style= "text-align:  justify; ">The  TEN-T  co-funded  studies  helped  the  beneficiary,  Polish  Airports,  finalise  two  crucial  documents  which  defined  the  development  needs  of  Chopin  Airport  infrastructure  and  adjust  them  to  air  traffic  forecasts  and  market  trends.  They  included  a  medium-term  development  strategy  until  2022  and  a  long-term  Master  Plan  for  development  for  2012-2037.  </p> 
<p  style= "text-align:  justify; "> </p> 
<p  style= "text-align:  justify; ">More  specifically,  the  studies  addressed  safety  issues  due  to  the  airport's  existing  location  and  infrastructure  (two  crossing  runways,  proximity  to  the  city  centre).  They  also  analysed  airport  operations,  taking  into  account  business  continuity  and  environmental  threats  (birds,  weather  conditions).  The  studies  also  looked  at  ways  to  reduce  the  airport's  own  negative  environmental  impact  using  measures  such  as  water-drainage  management  and  electric  energy  management.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p><strong>Benefits  of  the  project</strong></p> 
<p  style= "text-align:  justify; ">The  studies  and  their  findings  have  helped  to  reinforce  the  role  of  Chopin  Airport  as  a  key  TEN-T  node  by  increasing  its  efficiency,  capacity  and  improving  environmental  impact.  As  a  result,  the  airport  has  been  enhanced  by  construction  works,  and  benefitted  from  new  equipment  and  technical/IT  systems.</p> 
<p  style= "text-align:  justify; "> </p> 
<p  style= "text-align:  justify; ">In  addition,  the  studies  and  their  findings  have  contributed  to  the  introduction  of  precise  approach  and  landing  operations  in  low  visibility  conditions  at  the  airport,  plus  the  Runway  End  Safety  Area  adding  further  safety  features  to  the  airport  infrastructure.  They  have  also  been  instrumental  in  securing  EU  Cohesion  Funds  for  the  construction  of  a  new  aircraft  de-icing  pad.  Passengers  using  the  Chopin  Airport  will  benefit  from  a  higher  standard  of  service,  reduced  delays  in  aircraft  handling,  and  enhanced  safety  of  flight  operations,  leading  to  the  improved  quality  and  operations  of  the  TEN-T  network.</p>---<h2>Info  and  links</h2>---<p><span  style= "color:  #ff9900; "><strong>Member  States  involved:</strong></span></p>

<p><strong>Project  description</strong></p> 
<p  style= "text-align:  justify; ">The  Helsinki  to  Turku  motorway  connects  Finland's  capital  to  one  of  its  largest  cities.  This  project,  which  was  part  of  TEN-T  Priority  Project  12  (Nordic  Triangle  rail/road  axis),  aimed  at  completing  the  motorway.  It  involved  the  construction  of  a  new,  51  km  long  stretch  of  motorway  between  the  cities  of  Salo  and  Lohja,  as  well  as  the  creation  of  a  western  access  road  to  Lohja.  In  addition  to  the  motorway,  2.5  km  of  public  roads  and  23.8  km  of  private  roads  were  built  as  part  of  the  project.</p> 
<p  style= "text-align:  justify; "> </p> 
<p  style= "text-align:  justify; ">The  project  was  carried  out  as  life-cycle  based  public-private  partnership  (PPP),  in  which  the  private  partner  was  responsible  for  the  design,  construction,  maintenance  and  financing  of  the  works  in  exchange  for  a  fixed  term  lease  on  the  operation  of  the  infrastructure.  During  the  concession  period,  the  Finnish  Government  will  pay  a  service  fee  to  the  private  contractor  based  on  the  availability  (number  of  motorway  lanes  open  at  any  given  moment  in  time)  and  level  of  maintenance  of  the  road,  plus  a  payment  for  the  works.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p><strong>Benefits  of  the  project</strong></p> 
<p  style= "text-align:  justify; ">Completion  of  this  important  TEN-T  road  project  has  entailed  numerous  benefits  for  the  mobility  of  people  and  freight  in  the  region.  With  the  new  stretch  of  the  E18  motorway  finalised,  the  last  missing  road  link  between  Helsinki  and  Turku  has  disappeared  —  ensuring  reduced  travel  times  between  the  two  cities  and  improved  safety  of  road  transport  thanks  to  the  brand  new  infrastructure.  Furthermore,  local  population  has  benefitted  from  the  construction  of  public  and  private  roads  better  linking  the  region  together  and  to  the  motorway  itself.</p> 
<p  style= "text-align:  justify; "> </p> 
<p  style= "text-align:  justify; ">The  PPP  used  to  design,  build,  run  and  maintain  the  motorway  was  extremely  successful,  delivering  the  completed  infrastructure  two  years  earlier  than  expected.  It  showed  that  improved  efficiency  can  offset  the  higher  (private)  financing  costs.  Thanks  to  the  success  of  this  PPP  scheme,  as  well  as  another  one  signed  in  2011,  the  Finnish  authorities  are  considering  building  a  third  section  of  the  E18  motorway  using  the  same  approach,  in  this  case  between  the  cities  of  Hamina  and  Vaalima  to  complete  the  last  missing  motorway  link  between  Helsinki  and  the  Russian  border.</p>---<h2>Info  and  links</h2>---<p><span  style= "color:  #ff9900; "><strong>Member  States  involved:</strong></span></p>

<p  style= "text-align:  justify; ">The  maritime  link  between  Esbjerg,  Denmark  and  Zeebrugge,  Belgium,  has  been  in  service  since  2005,  providing  an  intermodal  alternative  to  road  transport  between  Denmark  and  the  Benelux  countries.</p> 
<p  style= "text-align:  justify; "> </p> 
<p  style= "text-align:  justify; ">The  TEN-T  funded  project  contributed  to  strengthening  the  development  of  a  Benelux-Scandinavia  short  sea  connection  —  including  an  improved  efficiency  of  the  maritime  link,  additional  investment  in  infrastructure  and  facilities  and  the  adoption  of  accompanying  measures  to  foster  integration  of  various  parts  of  the  intermodal  chain.</p> 
<p  style= "text-align:  justify; "> </p> 
<p  style= "text-align:  justify; ">As  part  of  the  project,  the  Ro-Ro  (roll  on,  roll  off)  connection  between  Esbjerg  and  Zeebrugge  was  improved  through  the  purchase  of  a  floating  Ro-Ro  ramp  and  a  Ro-Ro  jetty,  as  well  as  by  extending  the  port  access  way  in  Esbjerg.</p>

<p><strong>Benefits  of  the  project</strong></p> 
<p  style= "text-align:  justify; ">Completion  of  this  project  is  important  to  TEN-T  Priority  Project  21,  Motorways  of  the  Sea  (MoS).  It  also  has  improved  short-sea  shipping  between  the  two  North  Sea  ports,  allowing  Esbjerg  and  Zeebrugge  to  boost  their  roles  as  intermodal  nodes  for  freight  transport  in  northern  Europe.  MoS  corridors  have  also  been  promoted  as  viable  alternatives  to  land-based  transport,  thus  affecting  modal  split.</p> 
<p  style= "text-align:  justify; "> </p> 
<p  style= "text-align:  justify; ">The  improvements  realised  as  part  of  the  project  have  yielded  a  reduction  in  transport  costs  of  up  to  40%,  as  well  as  an  approximately  50%  decrease  in  CO2  emissions,  when  compared  to  the  alternative  land  route.  Consequently,  congestion  on  very  busy  parts  of  the  EU  road  network  has  been  reduced.  Freight  operators  can  now  benefit  from  a  cheaper  alternative  to  road  transport,  as  well  as  an  additional  way  of  reaching  peripheral  regions  of  the  EU.</p>---<h2>Info  and  links</h2>---<p><span  style= "color:  #ff9900; "><strong>Member  States  involved:</strong></span></p>

This  project  aimed  to  address  this  interoperability  issue  in  the  Port  of  Barcelona.  Its  main  objective  was  to  connect  the  Port  of  Barcelona's  railway  network  to  the  European  UIC  gauge  network  and  adapt  the  existing  railway  infrastructure  in  the  port.</p> 
<p  style= "text-align:  justify; "> </p> 
<p  style= "text-align:  justify; ">The  mainly  internal  railway  network  of  the  port  was  gradually  adapted  to  UIC  gauge  thanks  to  the  introduction  of  a  third  rail  between  the  two  existing  Iberian  gauge  rails.  It  also  extended  the  UIC  gauge  connection  to  additional  locations  in  the  port  (the  Prat  container  terminal  and  the  Moll  de  l'Energia)  to  allow  for  seamless  rail  traffic.</p>

<p  style= "text-align:  justify; ">Adapting  the  entire  rail  network  of  the  Port  of  Barcelona  to  European  UIC  gauge  is  set  to  generate  considerable  benefits  beyond  the  local  and  regional  aspect.</p> 
<p  style= "text-align:  justify; "> </p> 
<p  style= "text-align:  justify; ">Completion  of  the  project  will  now  allow  an  increase  of  the  use  of  rail  for  freight  transport  and  the  development  of  the  Port's  hinterland,  transforming  it  into  the  main  gateway  for  container  traffic  into  southern  Europe.

They  consisted  of  the  construction  of  two  new  underground  connections  between  the  stations  of  Porta  Susa  and  Stura,  replacing  the  surface  railway  line.  The  resulting  two  double-track  tunnels  constituted  the  continuation  of  the  Lingotto-Porta  Susa  bypass,  which  is  essential  for  the  arrival  of  the  high  speed  trains  to  Torino.</p>

<p><strong>Benefits  of  the  project</strong></p> 
<p  style= "text-align:  justify; ">The  objectives  of  the  project  were  to  adapt  the  network  to  high  speed  rail  traffic  and  improve  rail  services  in  the  greater  metropolitan  area  of  Torino  by  separating  regional  traffic  flows  from  the  medium/long  distance  ones  and  by  eliminating  the  traffic  interferences  between  fast  and  slow  trains  (removal  of  the  bottleneck).</p> 
<p  style= "text-align:  justify; "> </p> 
<p  style= "text-align:  justify; ">These  objectives  have  been  met  thanks  to  the  fourfold  increase  in  tracks  between  the  Porta  Susa  and  Stura  stations  which  has  allowed  the  separation  of  long-distance  traffic  flows  from  the  regional  ones,  generating  a  considerable  increase  in  capacity.  The  new  infrastructure,  in  fact,  is  able  to  manage  up  to  500  trains  per  day  —  more  than  double  the  value  prior  to  the  works.</p>

<p  style= "text-align:  justify; ">The  Westerscheldt  river,  located  on  the  border  between  Belgium  and  The  Netherlands,  is  a  very  important  axis  for  waterborne  transport,  used  by  both  maritime  and  inland  navigation  at  high  capacity.  In  2012,  the  Westerscheldt  counted  about  162,000  ship  movements  —  with  inland  navigation  accounting  for  54%  of  them.</p>

<p  style= "text-align:  justify; "> </p> 
<p  style= "text-align:  justify; ">Its  objective  was  to  adapt  existing  maritime  traffic  management  systems  in  order  to  offer  both  maritime  vessel  traffic  management  and  River  Information  Services.  A  study  was  carried  out  to  define  and  design  the  best  ICT  architecture  for  RIS.  Existing  systems  were  adapted  in  order  to  provide  RIS  key  technologies  and  services  such  as   "Notices  to  Skippers "  and  Inland  Electronic  Navigation  Charts  display  for  safe  and  smooth  navigation.  The  project  extended  an  existing  maritime  AIS  network  (Automatic  Identification  System)  to  an  Inland  AIS  network  and  implemented  a  Fairway  Information  Services  (FIS)  portal,  making  essential  inland  navigation  information  available  to  relevant  stakeholders.</p>

<p><strong>Project  description</strong></p> 
<p  style= "text-align:  justify; ">The  northern  Adriatic  sea  counts  a  number  of  important  ports  serving  the  Italian  (and  Slovenian)  hinterlands.  The  overall  objective  of  this  TEN-T  funded  study  was  to  develop  a  cluster  of  these  northern  Adriatic  ports  (Ravenna,  Trieste,  Venezia,  Ancona  and  Monfalcone  in  Italy,  Koper  in  Slovenia)  into  a  multi-port   "Adriatic  Gateway "  capable  of  providing  —  as  a  whole  —  an  efficient  system,  competitive  services  and  improved  cargo  interoperability  to  attract  increased  cargo  flows.</p> 
<p  style= "text-align:  justify; "> </p> 
<p  style= "text-align:  justify; ">The  study  focused  on  the  development  of  this  multimodal  and  multiport  gateway  connecting  the  Adriatic  Corridor  to  EU  mainland  logistic  platforms.  It  also  aimed  to  develop  strategic  sea  links  to  the  Mediterranean  and  Black  Sea  regions,  based  in  particular  on  the  Motorways  of  the  Seas  concept.  Models  of  excellence  were  identified  covering  all  of  the  relevant  aspects  of  port  and  logistics  operations.  Based  on  this,  the   "Adriatic  Gateway "  was  designed,  integrating  it  into  the  European  inland  multimodal  transport  and  logistics  network.</p> 
<p  style= "text-align:  justify; "> </p> 
<p  style= "text-align:  justify; "><strong>Benefits  of  the  project</strong></p> 
<p  style= "text-align:  justify; ">The  projects  was  carried  out  in  synergy  with  the   "ITS  Adriatic  Multi-port  Gateway "  study  (to  be  completed  by  the  end  of  2013),  which  intends  to  establish  a  network  of  north  Adriatic  port  community  systems  capable  of  integrating  via  the  internet  all  the  transport  community  members  and  to  exchange  data  on  shipping  lines  and  vessels  operating  between  sea  ports  and  harbors,  in  order  to  achieve  coordination  and  integration.</p> 
<p  style= "text-align:  justify; "> </p> 
<p  style= "text-align:  justify; ">The  project  successfully  defined  the  characteristics  of  a  multimodal,  multiport  gateway  that  could  converge  traffic  flows  from  the  eastern  Mediterranean  and  the  Black  Sea,  reconnecting  them  via  the  Adriatic  Corridor  to  the  TEN-T  Network.  The  cluster  of  six  participating  ports  in  the  northern  Adriatic  (from  Ancona  to  Koper)  can  now  be  linked  to  each  other  and  connected  to  inland  logistical  platforms  to  optimise  maritime  and  intermodal  transport.</p>---<h2>Info  and  links</h2>---<p><span  style= "color:  #ff9900; "><strong>Member  States  involved:</strong></span></p>

<p> </p> 
<p>A  successful  case  study  on  best  practice  PPP  procurement  was  carried  out  for  the  ERTMS  deployment  project  <a  id= "PAGE112470001338660 "  title= "2011-ES-60002-P "  href= "javascript:void(0); ">2011-ES-60002-P</a>,  the  Albacete-Alicante  section  of  the  Madrid-Castilla  La  Mancha-Comunidad  Valenciana-Region  de  Murcia  high  speed  line.  The  ERTMS  project  was  part  of  a  signalling  and  telecommunications  investment  that  was  procured  by  ADIF  (the  Spanish  publicly-owned  railway  infrastructure  management  authority  and  key  stakeholder  of  the  project)  using  a  PPP  model.  The  action  aimed  at  equipping  ETCS  level  2  on  the  double-track  of  this  section,  complying  with  the  baseline  version  2.3.0d.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  165  km  long  Albacete-Alicante  section  is  one  of  the  most  complex  routes  in  Spain,  and  an  important  part  of  TEN-T  <a  title= "Priority  Project  19 "  href= "/en/ten-t/ten-t_projects/30_priority_projects/priority_project_19/priority_project_19.htm ">Priority  Project  19</a>  (High  speed  rail  interoperability  on  the  Iberian  peninsula).</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  PPP  case  study  was  developed  on  the  initiative  of  INEA,  with  the  assistance  of  the  European  Commission,  in  close  cooperation  with  the  project's  main  stakeholders  including  ADIF,  Alstom,  the  key  private  sector  technology  provider  and  the  European  Investment  Bank  as  structurer  and  lender.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  objectives  of  the  study  were  to:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Outline  the  process  underlying  the  decision  to  proceed  with  the  PPP  procurement  model</li> 
<li>Identify  the  role  of  PPP  procurement  and  TEN-T  support  in  the  case  of  an  ERTMS  deployment  project  in  Spain</li> 
<li>Investigate  risk  identification,  risk  transfer,  contract  management  and  certification  procedure</li> 
<li>Discuss  the  possibility  of  replicating  the  approach  in  other  projects  and  regions</li> 
</ul> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  approach  of  the  study  was  to:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Present  the  current  status  of  the  project  and  investigate  its  preparation  process  from  the  point  of  view  of  risk-sharing  agreements.   </li> 
<li>Provide  a  general  overview  of  ERTMS  including  technical  and  organisational  issues,  as  well  as  summarize  current  status  of  its  development  in  Spain</li> 
<li>Suggest  the  ways  to  transfer  best  practices  to  other  ERTMS  projects  based  on  the  gathered  evidence  and  real  life  experience</li> 
</ul> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  findings  showed  that  a  key  success  factor  was  the  early  involvement  of  the  EIB  to  provide  structuring  advice  and  optimise  the  use  of  EIB  financial  support.  The  PPP  model  shifted  the  financing  from  a  corporate  to  a  project  finance  scheme,  which  reduced  the  burden  on  corporate  resources  and  created  conditions  for  an  attractive  EIB  loan  and  the  participation  of  financial  investors.  Finally,  the  scope  of  the  risk  transfer  and  the  alignment  of  interests  was  optimal  for  an  ERTMS  project.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Implementation  (concerning  the  ERTMS  deployment)  is  ahead  of  schedule,  with  entry  into  commercial  service  expected  in  advance  of  the  31  December  2014  project  end  date.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  case  study  was  effective  because  it  highlighted  the:</p> 
<p>1.  role  of  the  EIB  not  only  as  lender,  but  also  as  structure</p> 
<p>2.  expertise  of  the  public  sector  team  to  manage  the  technical  evaluation  and  the  PPP  procurement</p> 
<p>3.  suitability  of  a  PPP  procurement  for  superstructure  projects  (signalling,  electrification  and  substation)</p>
