<p><strong><em>The  European  Commission  launched  today  the  </em></strong><a  id= "PAGE112470000002350 "  title= "Calls  for  Proposals  2009 "  href= "javascript:void(0); "><strong><em>2009  TEN-T  Calls  for  Proposals</em></strong></a><strong><em>,  making  nearly  &euro;1  billion  of  financing  available  for  European  transport  infrastructure  projects.  This  year's  Calls  include  a  &euro;500  million  call  in  the  framework  of  the  Commission's  European  Economic  Recovery  Plan,  aimed  at  giving  an  immediate  boost  to  the  European  economy  by  accelerating  investments  in  infrastructure.  In  addition,  there  will  be&nbsp;  funding  opportunities  under  the  TEN-T  Annual  Programme  and  Multi-Annual  Programme,  whose  priorities  in  this  Call  include  Motorways  of  the  Sea,  Intelligent  Transport  Systems  for  Road,  and  the  European  Rail  Traffic  Management  System  (ERTMS).  The  Trans-European  Transport  Network  Executive  Agency  (TEN-T  EA),  which  manages  the  technical  and  financial  implementation  of  the  TEN-T  programme,  is  responsible  for  the  management  of  the  calls  for  proposals  and  the  evaluation  of  project  proposals  submitted  on  behalf  of  its   "parent ",  DG  Energy  and  Transport.</em></strong></p> 
<p><br></p> 
<p>Commission  Vice  President  Antonio  Tajani,  responsible  for  transport,  noted   "I  am  convinced  that  stimulating  economic  demand  with  an  ambitious  programme  of  European  infrastructure  is  one  of  the  most  tangible,  rapid  and  efficient  responses  that  we  can  give  to  today's  economic  crisis.  This  programme  is  TEN-T,  and  its  implementation  will  ensure  job  security  for  many  Europeans  in  important  sectors  such  as  construction,  which  is  -  and  always  has  been  -  a  major  employer  and  contributor  to  GDP.  For  this  reason,  the  Commission,  in  the  framework  of  the  European  Economic  Recovery  Plan,  has  decided  to  bring  forward  &euro;500  million  of  funds  as  part  of  this  year's  TEN-T  funding  opportunities. "</p> 
<p><br></p> 
<p>This  year's  Calls  for  Proposals  have  been  established  under  three  separate  work  programmes:</p> 
<p><br></p> 
<p><strong>1.  </strong>&euro;500  million  of  TEN-T  funds  have  been  brought  forward  under  the  European  Economic  Recovery  Plan,  as  a  response  to  the  economic  and  financial  crisis  facing  Europe.  This  ad  hoc  work  programme,  adopted  this  year,  supports  works  which  can  start  in  2009  or  2010  and  be  largely  implemented  over  this  two-year  period.</p> 
<p><br></p> 
<p><strong>2.</strong>  The  Multi-annual  Work  Programme  aims  to  finance  the  highest  priorities  of  the  TEN-T  network.  This  year's  Call  focuses  on  three  fields:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Motorways  of  the  Sea  (TEN-T  Priority  Project  21),  providing  viable  alternatives  for  congested  roads  by  shifting  freight  to  sea  routes:  maximum  &euro;30  million</li> 
<li>European  Rail  Traffic  Management  Systems  (ERTMS),  harmonising  European  rail  signalling  systems:  maximum  &euro;240  million</li> 
<li>Intelligent  Transport  Systems  for  Roads  (ITS  Roads),  using  the  integration  of  information  and  communications  technology  to  create  more  efficient  and  safer  road  transport:  maximum  &euro;100  million</li> 
</ul> 
<p><strong>3.  </strong>The  flexible  Annual  Work  Programme  (&euro;140  million)  complements  the  efforts  developed  under  the  Multi-annual  Work  Programme.  It  includes  an  amount  of  &euro;  60  million  for  the  Loan  Guarantee  Instrument,  which  represents  the  Commission's  annual  contribution.  It  will  be  made  available  to  the  European  Investment  Bank  (EIB).</p> 
<p><br></p> 
<p>Potential  applicants  are  invited  to  submit  proposals  by  15  May  2009,  which  will  be  evaluated  on  their  relevance  to  TEN-T  priorities  and  policy  objectives,  their  maturity,  their  impact  -  particularly  on  the  environment  and  their  quality  in  terms  of  completeness,  clarity,  soundness  and  coherence.<br></p> 
<p>The  TEN-T  EA  is  also  planning  to  host  an  <a  id= "PAGE112470000000541 "  title= "TEN-T  Info  Day  -  22  April  2009 "  href= "javascript:void(0); "><strong>Info  Day</strong></a>  on  22  April  2009  in  Brussels  which  will  provide  more  information  about  the  Calls  and  the  evaluation  process.&nbsp;</p>

<p> </p> 
<p>The  vision  for  the  new  “Adriatic  Gateway”  is  to  ensure  maximum  competitiveness  for  the  ports  involved  and  to  ensure  that  sea  traffic  flows  in  the  region  are  integrated  with  the  inland  logistic  infrastructure.  This,  in  turn,  will  boost  the  attractiveness  of  sea  shipping  and  increase  the  freight  traffic  flows  for  the  participating  ports.</p>

Set  to  receive  almost  €25  million  from  the  EU  up  to  December  2013,  the  project  will  contribute  towards  the  realisation  of  <a  id= "PAGE112470000000637 "  title= "Priority  Project  21 "  href= "javascript:void(0); ">Priority  Project  21  (Motorways  of  the  Sea)</a>  by  fostering  an  efficient  and  environmentally  friendly  intermodal  transport  solution  in  the  region.</em></strong></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  ports  of  Aarhus,  Gothenburg  and  Tallinn  have  established  the  “Baltic  Sea  Hub  and  Spokes”  project  under  the  Motorways  of  the  Sea  which  was  retained  for  EU  co-funding  under  the  2010  TEN-T  Multi-Annual  Call.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  project  complies  with  the  EU’s  strategy  for  the  Baltic  Sea  region.  Due  to  the  expansion  of  the  economic  zone  in  the  Baltic  Sea  and  the  increasing  cooperation  with  the  Far  East,  there  is  the  need  to  develop  the  hub  ports  in  the  region  to  handle  existing  volumes  and  future  growth  in  freight  and  passenger  traffic.  To  assure  this,  the  hub  port  system  in  Aarhus/Gothenburg  and  the  spoke  system  of  feeder  ports  in  the  entire  Baltic  Sea  region  should  be  developed  through  a  higher  integration  and  closer  cooperation  and  coordination,  on  top  of  further  development  of  the  individual  ports.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  main  objectives  of  this  project  are  to  facilitate  an  efficient,  environmentally  friendly  and  attractive  intermodal  transport  solution  for  the  region  and  to  improve  access  to  its  markets.  This  will  increase  possibilities  for  trade  and  growth,  which  will  lead  to  an  increase  in  the  flow  of  goods  by  sea.  This,  in  turn,  will  help  the  ports  grow  and  develop  and  make  the  individual  countries  more  competitive.</p>

<p>European  Coordinator  for  ERTMS  Karel  Vinck  visited  the  TEN-T  EA  on  Thursday  7  May  2009  to  be  better  acquainted  with  the  Agency  and  its  work  and  in  order  to  explain  his  role  as  European  Coordinator  and  answer  questions  from  staff.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Executive  Director  Dirk  Beckers  welcomed  Mr  Vinck  to  the  Agency  and  delivered  a  short  introductory  presentation  before  leaving  the  floor  to  Mr  Giogkarakis-Argyropoulos,  who  explained  in  detail  the  functioning  of  the  TEN-T  EA  Unit  dealing  with  ERTMS,  focusing  on  the  importance  of  the  system  for  European  rail  transport  and  outlining  the  situation  of  the  current  open  call.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Mr  Vinck  agreed,  in  his  own  presentation,  with  the  absolute  importance  of  creating  a  harmonised  and  unified  rail  signalling  system  throughout  Europe,  something  achievable  only  via  the  swift  installation  of  ERTMS  in  all  EU  Member  States.  This  will  guarantee,  according  to  the  European  Coordinator,  full  interoperability  between  Member  States,  removing  bottlenecks  from  the  lines  and  increasing  travel  speeds  and  safety  levels.  Mr  Vinck  stressed  that,  for  this  to  be  possible,  it  would  be  necessary  to  reduce  the  costs,  for  private  companies,  of  migrating  towards  the  new  technology,  something  which  the  European  Commission,  through  the  calls  and  funds  managed  by  the  TEN-T  EA,  is  already  doing.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>ERTMS-focused  projects  hence  play  a  key  role  in  the  deployment  of  the  system  and  provide  a  solution  as  society  increasingly  turns  towards  rail  transport,  perceiving  it  to  be  greener  and  more  efficient  than  its  alternatives.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The  presentation  was  followed  by  a  Q&amp;A  session  between  TEN-T  EA  staff  and  Mr  Vinck  during  which  a  series  of  issues  pertaining  to  ERTMS  were  raised,  from  financing  and  implementation  to  deployment  and  standards.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Mr  Beckers  then  concluded  the  open  session,  which  was  followed  by  a  closed  one  between  the  Coordinator,  TEN-T  EA  Unit  T2,  DG  TREN  and  ERA.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Mr  Vinck  was  the  third  European  Coordinator  to  visit  the  TEN-T  EA,  being  preceded  in  February  2009  by  Karla  Peijs,  which  acts  as  Coordinator  for  Inland  Waterways  and  in  March  2009  by  P&eacute;ter  Bal&aacute;zs.</p>---<p><a  id= "PAGE112470000000118 "  title= "Newsroom "  href= "javascript:void(0); ">Back  to  news  list</a>  <img  style= "border:  0pt  none;  vertical-align:  middle; "  src= "/images/layout/bullet_next.gif "  alt= " "></p>

<p> </p> 
<p>The  proposal  to  support  a  feasibility  study  for  the  modernisation  and  extension  of  the  Katowice  railway  junction  was  submitted  under  a  Call  for  Proposals  which  was  published  in  2010.  It  was  retained  for  funding  under  the  TEN-T  programme,  following  an  evaluation  procedure  carried  out  by  the  European  Commission  and  the  TEN-T  Executive  Agency.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  feasibility  study  (which  is  the  continuation  of  a  previous  pre-feasibility  study,  also  funded  by  the  TEN-T  Programme)  will  help  to  determine  the  type  of  modernisation  required  for  the  railway  junction  in  Katowice.  It  concerns  the  final  definition  of  modernisation  variants  (by  means  of  analysis  covering  technical  and  financial  aspects)  enabling  elaboration  of  detailed  design  and  tender  documentation  for  the  construction  works,  as  well  as  the  necessary  administrative  parallel  activities  (e.g.  environmental  decision,  building  permit  etc.).</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  completion  of  the  feasibility  study  will  be  an  important  milestone  in  the  modernisation  of  the  Katowice  rail  junction  and  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  the  TEN-T  network  as  a  whole  and  <a  id= "PAGE112470000000641 "  title= "Priority  Project  23 "  href= "javascript:void(0); ">Priority  Project  23</a>  (Railway  axis  Gda&#324;sk-Warszawa-Brno/Bratislava-Wien)  in  particular.</p>

The  works  are  co-funded  by  the  European  Commission  under  the  European  Economic  Recovery  Plan*  (EERP)  Call  launched  on  30  March  2009.  The  <a  id= "PAGE112470000128135 "  title= "EERP  Projects "  href= "javascript:void(0); ">EERP's  TEN-T  projects</a>,  such  as  the  Maastricht  tunnel,  aim  to  boost  the  European  economy  by  increasing  Community  investment  in  strategic  sectors  such  as  infrastructure  &ndash;  giving  a  positive  after-effect  on  European  mobility  as  a  whole.</strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The  inauguration  ceremony  for  the  Maastricht  works  was  attended  by  European  Commission  Vice-President  Antonio  Tajani,  Dutch  Minister  for  Transport  Camiel  Eurlings  and  Mayor  of  Maastricht  Gerd  Leers.  The  &euro;690  million  project,  expected  to  be  completed  by  2016,  consists  of  building  a  tunnel  within  urban  Maastricht  along  the  route  of  the  E25/A2  motorway.  This  will  eliminate  the  last  six  remaining  traffic  lights  along  a  route  spanning  from  Amsterdam  to  Genova  and  onwards  to  Palermo,  Italy  -  rendering  traffic  more  fluid  along  this  vital  north-south  road  axis.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>By  moving  traffic  underground,  the  city  of  Maastricht  will  also  benefit  from  increased  safety,  reduced  congestion  and  a  decreased  environmental  impact.  Furthermore,  the  new  tunnel  will  also  allow  the  city  to  refurbish  a  large  area  and  connect  traffic  to  the  A79  motorway  and  the  Beatrixhaven  industrial  estate  and  inland  water  terminal.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Vice-President  Tajani  commented,   "<em>Today's  launch  of  a  key  project  co-funded  by  the  European  Commission  exemplifies  how  effective  infrastructure  development  can  positively  affect  national  and  international  mobility,  jump  start  the  economy,  as  well  as  improve  the  life  of  Maastricht's  citizens.  The  construction  of  the  tunnel  will  complete  a  vital  TEN-T  link  connecting  northern  and  southern  Europe,  and  thus  further  integrate  European  transport  aims.</em> "</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The  Maastricht  project  was  one  of  39  successful  initiatives  benefiting  from  EERP  funding,  a  programme  endorsed  by  the  European  Council  in  December  2008.  The  EERP  is  aimed  at  boosting  the  European  economy  during  the  current  economic  and  financial  crisis  by  increasing  Community  investment  in  defined  strategic  sectors  and  in  particular  in  infrastructure  projects,  with  the  objectives  of  giving  an  immediate  boost  to  the  economy  and  at  the  same  time  enhancing  Europe's  longer-term  sustainable  growth  potential.  The  Maastricht  tunnel  will  receive  a  contribution  from  the  EU  of  &euro;15  million.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>European  funding  of  infrastructure  projects  is  of  paramount  importance  to  re-launch  the  economy  and  promote  the  competitiveness  of  the  continent's  industry  and  also  acts  as  a  catalyst  for  national  investments:  for  every  &euro;1  of  Community  funding,  in  fact,  more  than  &euro;10  of  additional  public  or  private  funds  will  be  invested.</p>

The  event  was  organised  by  the  Trans-European  Transport  Network  Executive  Agency  (TEN-T  EA)  mainly  to  offer  the  possibility  to  TEN-T  funding  beneficiaries  to  provide  feedback  regarding  their  experience  with  TEN-T  funding  and  succeeded  in  its  goals,  attracting  over  300  participants.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The  event  was  opened  by  TEN-T  EA  Executive  Director  Dirk  Beckers,  who  outlined  how  the  Agency  changed  considerably  during  the  last  twelve  months  before  moving  on  to  introducing  a  series  of  presentations  about  the  main  topics  of  the  Workshop:  Calls  for  Proposals,  Decisions,  Evaluation,  Strategic  Action  Plans  (SAPs),  Action  Status  Reports  (ASRs)  and  the  Payment  Cycle  among  others.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Three  thematic  break-out  sessions  were  also  organised  to  present  a  series  of  best  practices  and  give  participants  the  opportunity  to  intervene  and  comment.  The  results  from  these  discussions  were  then  presented  during  the  morning  of  the  second  day  to  the  plenary  assembly,  in  order  to  collect  feedback  from  everyone  on  the  various  points  raised  the  previous  day.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Mr  Beckers  concluded  the  event  by  summarising  the  key  points  which  emerged  from  the  various  discussions  and  ensuring  that  the  Agency  would  pay  close  attention  to  them  and  improve  its  procedures  accordingly.  He  insisted  that  the  success  of  the  Workshop  would  rely  on  implementing  comments  received  in  order  to  streamline  and  simplify  procedures  within  the  Agency  to  offer  an  ever  better  service  to  beneficiaries.</p>

"112470000540942","1322664217","EERP  mid-term  review  shows  EU  funding  essential  to  kick-start  investment","European  Union  funding  for  infrastructure  projects  has  proved  to  be  crucial.","","<p><strong><em>European  Union  funding  for  infrastructure  projects  has  proved  to  be  crucial  for  the  launch  or  implementation  of  90%  of  the  projects  covered  by  the  European  Economic  Recovery  Plan  (EERP),  according  to  a  new  report.  The  mid-term  review  of  Trans-European  Transport  Network  (TEN-T)  investment  into  EERP  concluded  that  the  funding  has  been  vital  for  attracting  further  investment  from  the  private  sector  and  public  authorities.  This  review  was  carried  out  to  assess  the  progress  of  individual  EERP  funded  projects  and  to  measure  the  extent  to  which  the  Plan  is  meeting  its  objective  of  contributing  to  boosting  the  European  economy  and  speeding  up  transport  construction  in  Member  States.</em></strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Commission  Vice-President  Siim  Kallas,  responsible  for  transport,  said:   "The  TEN-T  has  an  essential  role  to  play  as  a  catalyst  for  further  funding.  Even  if  TEN-T  only  pledges  to  fund  10%  of  the  project,  it  is  already  enough  to  attract  the  rest  of  the  needed  investment.  These  &euro;500  million  we  are  investing  into  the  TEN-T  network  through  the  EERP  will  play  a  critical  role  in  revitalising  the  European  economy.  Although  work  is  ongoing,  it  is  very  encouraging  to  see  that  the  large  majority  of  projects  are  on  schedule.  This  assessment  also  confirms  the  centralised  management  of  TEN-T  funding,  a  direct  follow-up  to  the  mid-term  review  conducted  last  year.  I  expect  that  this  close  monitoring  will  help  the  EU  and  the  Member  States  to  implement  the  available  resources  in  the  most  optimal  way.  This  is  an  important  lesson  for  our  discussion  on  CEF  for  the  post  2014  period. "</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The  EU  launched  EERP  in  response  to  the  financial  crisis  of  2008,  and  as  a  part  of  this,  &euro;500  million  of  TEN-T  funds  were  advanced  to  2009.  Mature  projects  were  selected  to  allow  a  prompt  start  in  2009,  and  investment  continued  in  2010.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The  present  mid-term  review  covered  all  the  36  construction  projects  co-financed  (out  of  99  eligible  project  proposals).  The  selected  projects  reflect  TEN-T's  commitment  to  environmentally  friendly  modes,  with  18  actions  being  rail,  multi-modal  port  and  inland  waterway  projects  Eight  projects  (representing  19.5%  of  the  funding)  address  ITS,  ATM  and  airports.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The  co-financing  rate  was  only  10-20%,  but  sufficient  to  release  national  or  private  funds  even  in  times  of  austerity.  The  review  also  revealed  that  two-thirds  of  the  selected  initiatives  are  being  implemented  on  time  (or  with  a  slight  delay  of  no  more  than  six  months).</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Background</strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong><em>List  of  projects</em></strong></p> 
<p>The  mid-term  review  was  based  on  an  analysis  of  annual  progress  reports  submitted  by  beneficiaries  to  the  TEN-T  Executive  Agency[1].  This  analysis  was  complemented  by  qualitative  information  gathered  from  representatives  of  Member  States  involved  in  the  projects  through  interviews  and  questionnaires.  The  TEN-T  Executive  Agency  coordinated  the  exercise,  with  the  support  of  an  independent  expert  who  prepared  the  final  report.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The  report  and  the  list  of  projects  are  available  available  here:  <a  id= "PAGE112470000128135 "  title= "EERP  Projects "  href= "javascript:void(0); ">http://tentea.ec.europa.eu/en/ten-t_projects/eerp_projects/</a></p>

<p>The  deadline  for  submitting  proposals  is  13  April  2012.  Proposals  will  be  evaluated  on  the  basis  of  their  relevance  to  the  TEN-T  priorities  and  policy  objectives,  their  maturity,  their  impact  &ndash;  in  particular  socio-economic  and  environmental  &ndash;  and  their  quality  in  terms  of  completeness,  clarity,  soundness  and  coherence.</p>

These  include  projects  in  the  fields  of  Motorways  of  the  Sea  and  River  Information  Services  under  the  Multi-Annual  Programme.  In  addition,  the  Annual  Programme  has  been  fine-tuned  in  2010  to  allow  us  to  prepare  for  future  transport  priorities,  notably  making  transport  greener,  and  to  increase  the  participation  of  private  partners  in  transport  infrastructure  projects.  This  funding  complements  the  &euro;7.16  billion  which  has  already  been  allocated  under  the  2007-2013  TEN-T  programme  to  around  300  projects  covering  all  transport  modes  &mdash;  air,  rail,  road  and  maritime/sea,  plus  logistics  and  intelligent  transport  systems  &mdash;&nbsp;  involving  all  EU  Member  States.

<li>River  Information  Services  (RIS),  involving  traffic  management  infrastructure  on  the  inland  waterway  network:  maximum  budget  &euro;10  million</li>

<li><strong>A  Core  Network</strong>,  to  be  completed  by  2030  and  featuring  high  technical  standards  such  as  ERTMS  (European  Rail  Traffic  Management  System)  and  Intelligent  Transport  Systems  for  roads  and  other  modes  of  transport.  The  core  network  will  consist  of  10  major  pan-European  transport  corridors,  each  chaired  by  a  European  coordinator.</li> 
<li><strong>A  Comprehensive  Network</strong>,  to  be  completed  by  2050,  which  will  complement  the  core  network  and  ensure  full  coverage  of  even  the  remotest  areas  of  the  European  Union.</li>

<li>86  main  European  ports  with  rail  and  road  links</li> 
<li>37  key  airports  with  rail  connections  into  major  cities</li>

<li>35  major  cross-border  projects  to  reduce  bottlenecks</li> 
</ul> 
<p>The  next  step  in  the  legislative  process  will  be  approval  by  the  European  Parliament  in  first  reading,  currently  foreseen  for  early  2013.   This  could  lead  to  the  final  text  being  adopted  within  the  first  half  of  2013.</p>

The  project,  which  focuses  on  optimising  existing  RIS-related  processes  as  well  as  conducting  ad-hoc  studies  and  surveys,  will  be  supported  with  a  grant  of  over  €500,000  from  the  TEN-T  budget.</strong></em></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The   "Implementation  of  River  Information  Services  (RIS)  in  Flanders  III "  project,  which  was  selected  for  funding  under  the  2011  TEN-T  Multi-Annual  Call,  will,  once  completed,  allow  for  faster  and  safer  transit  through  the  Flemish  inland  waterway  network  and  contribute  to  making  this  transport  mode  more  competitive.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>River  Information  Services  are  customised  information  services  that  make  it  possible  to  co-ordinate  logistical  processes  on  inland  waterways  with  actual  transport  situations  on  a  constant  basis.  RIS  play  a  key  role  in  making  cargo  transport  and  passenger  services  on  waterways  more  efficient  and  ecologically  sound  while,  at  the  same  time,  increasing  traffic  safety.  RIS  Services  are  defined  by  a  European  Framework  Directive  and  need  to  be  implemented  by  the  Member  States  in  a  harmonised  way.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>More  specifically,  the  project  builds  on  and  completes  projects   "RIS  in  Flanders  I  and  II "  (both  also  funded  via  the  TEN-T  Programme),  both  of  which  supported  the  installation  of  RIS  infrastructure,  and  aims  at  extending  the  range  of  RIS  services  available  in  Flanders.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  project,  which  is  managed  by  the  Trans-European  Transport  Network  Executive  Agency,  is  expected  to  be  completed  by  December  2013.</p>

The  projects  will  improve  the  safety  of  rail  transport  whilst  at  the  same  time  making  the  sector  more  competitive.</strong></em></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  two  projects  were  selected  for  funding  under  the  2011  TEN-T  Multi-Annual  Call.  The  first,  which  is  set  to  receive  an  EU  contribution  of  over  €18  million,  involves  equipping  the  entire  existing  Spanish  high  speed  rail  network  (over  1,000  km)  with  the  latest  consolidated  version  of  European  Train  Control  System  (ETCS),  which  guarantees  a  common  standard  that  enables  trains  to  cross  national  borders  and  enhances  overall  safety.  The  project  will  also  support  the  upgrade  to  the  same  level  of  231  high  speed  locomotives.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  second  project,  which  will  receive  over  €4.4  million  in  EU  co-financing,  consists  of  deploying  ERTMS  trackside  equipment  on  the  Albacete  to  Alicante  high  speed  rail  section,  which  is  currently  being  built.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Both  projects  will  be  managed  by  the  Trans-European  Transport  Network  Executive  Agency  and  are  expected  to  last  until  December  2014.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The  92  projects  account  for  approximately  two-thirds  of  the  total  TEN-T  budget  (&euro;5.301  billion  out  of  a  total  &euro;8.013  billion)  and  78%  of  the  total  MAP  for  the  entire  2007-2013  period.  The  total  budgeted  cost  of  these  projects  is  &euro;32.647  billion.  Therefore,  the  TEN-T  budget  accounts  for  approximately  16%  of  the  projects'  budgeted  costs.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The  results  of  this   "Mid-Term  Review "  of  the  Multi  Annual  Programme  have  outlined  how,  despite  the  recent  years  of  economic  stagnation,  good  progress  has  been  made  on  most  projects,  which  will  be  completed  by  their  original  deadline.

<p> </p> 
<p>Siim  Kallas,  European  Commission  Vice-President  in  charge  of  transport,  noted:   "I  am  delighted  that  this  important  project  is  becoming  operational.  It  proves  that  EU  financial  support  to  transport  infrastructure  generates  further  investment  and  employment  and  gives  substantial  benefits  to  citizens.  With  this  new  link  we  have  created  a  more  efficient  intermodal  hub  at  Brussels  Airport. "</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  project  involves  completing  a  rail  section  linking  Brussels  Zaventem  Airport  with  the  existing  Brussels-Antwerp-Amsterdam  and  Paris-Brussels-Köln-Amsterdam-London  high-speed  rail  networks,  also  known  as  TEN-T  Priority  Project  2.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  airport  used  to  be  only  accessible  by  a  dead-end  railway  station  served  by  local  and  regional  trains,  or  by  very  busy  road.  The  completion  of  the  link  to  Brussels  Airport  further  enhances  Europe's  network  of  high-speed  railway  lines  and  the  creation  of  an  interoperable  and  continuous  rail  network.  It  will  also  help  reduce  the  isolation  of  the  airport  by  improving  accessibility  and  reducing  congestion.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  European  Commission  and  the  TEN-T  EA,  which  have  followed  the  project  from  start  to  finish,  welcome  tomorrow's  inauguration  as  a  key  step  in  the  advancement  of  European  high-speed  railways  and  European  mobility  as  a  whole.</p>

"112470002423005","1296134478","First  interoperable  rail  link  opens  between  Iberian  peninsula  and  France","A  new  railway  section  linking  the  Spanish  and  French  networks  is  inaugurated.","","<p><strong>A  new  railway  section  linking  the  Spanish  and  French  networks  opens  today  thanks  to  about  &euro;70  million  in  European  Union  funding.  The  44.4  km  Perpignan-Figueras  railway  section  is  suitable  for  both  high-speed  rail  and  freight  transport  and  is  expected  to  significantly  cut  journey  times.  The  official  opening  was  attended  by  the  Spanish  Minister  of  Development,  Jose  Blanco  L&oacute;pez,  the  French  Secretary  of  State  for  Transport,  M.  Thierry  Mariani,  and  the  European  coordinator  Carlo  Secchi,  on  behalf  of  the  European  Commission.</strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Mr  Secchi,  who  is  responsible  on  behalf  of  the  Commission  for  coordinating  high-speed  rail  links  in  south-west  Europe,  including  the  Madrid-Barcelona-Lyon  line,  said:   "This  link  between  the  two  main  high-speed  rail  European  networks  overcomes  an  historical  natural  barrier.  The  new  cross-border  section  represents  a  major  achievement  for  the  internal  market  and  for  the  mobility  of  citizens.  I  am  proud  the  European  Union  played  such  an  essential  role  in  making  this  possible. "</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The  cross-border  section,  ensuring  the  first  interoperable  connection  between  the  Iberian  Peninsula  and  the  rest  of  the  European  Union,  was  completed  in  2009,  and  its  implementation  was  made  possible  by  Trans-European  Transport  Network  (TEN-T)  co-financing  of  &euro;69.75  million,  which  represents  25%  of  the  costs  of  works.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Works  for  its  connection  to  the  Spanish  network  were  completed  in  December  2010.  Consequently,  trains  in  standard  ( "European ")  gauge  can  now  travel  across,  linking  the  two  largest  European  high-speed  networks.  The  Spanish  high-speed  network  is  in  standard  gauge,  while  the  conventional  lines,  including  the  old  border  crossing,  are  in  the  wider  Iberian  gauge.  This  section  overcomes  this  problem  which  so  far  had  been  limiting  cross-border  flows.  The  line  passes  through  the  new  8  km  Pertus  tunnel.  High-speed  trains  can  run  on  it  at  350km/h.  To  ensure  safe  and  intensive  use,  it  is  equipped  with  the  interoperable  European  signalling  and  control  system  &ndash;  European  Rail  Traffic  Monitoring  System  (ERTMS)  &ndash;  that  constantly  monitors  traffic  flows  and  provides  feedback  to  the  trains.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The  new  international  services  reduce  journey  time  from  Barcelona  to  the  French  network  by  about  one  hour,  and  their  launch  has  already  proved  to  be  a  commercial  success.  The  full  completion  of  the  high-speed  line  between  Barcelona  and  the  cross-border  section,  expected  for  2012,  will  bring  Barcelona  to  just  50  minutes  from  Perpignan  &ndash;  instead  of  more  than  3h30  today  &ndash;  and  will  considerably  enhance  rail  flows  both  for  passengers  and  freight,  efficiently  connecting  two  of  the  most  important  cities  and  Mediterranean  ports  (Barcelona  and  Valencia)  to  the  rest  of  the  EU  rail  network.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Thanks  to  the  continuing  efforts  made,  the  full  Mediterranean  arc  from  Valencia  to  Lyon  is  expected  to  be  operational  in  2020.  By  that  time,  travelling  from  Barcelona  to  Paris  will  take  only  4h30  instead  of  eight  hours.  The  journey  from  Barcelona  to  Lyon  will  take  only  2h40.</p>

<p>Commission    Vice-President  Siim  Kallas,  responsible  for  transport,  said:   "I  am    delighted  to  be  signing  the  decision  today  that  gives  the  green  light  to    &euro;170  million  of  the  TEN-T  budget  to  co-finance  key  infrastructure    projects  of  European  added  value.

<p>Over    the  course  of  2010,  51  projects  involving  24  Member  States  were    selected  to  receive    funding  as  part  of  three  separate  calls.  All    projects  were  evaluated  on  the  basis  of  their  relevance  to  TEN-T    priorities  and  policy  objectives:  their  maturity,  their  impact    (particularly  socio-economic  and  environmental)  and  their  quality  in    terms  of  completeness,  clarity,  soundness  and  coherence.  The  awarded    funding  helps  to  attract  substantial  public  and  private  financing,  with    the  leverage  effect  being  almost  five  times  the  level  of  EU  assistance    (see  <a  href= "http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/11/101&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=fr "  target= "_blank ">MEMO/11/101</a>).</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The  <strong>2010  multi-annual  work  programme  (&euro;112.4  million  in  total  funding)</strong>  aimed  to  finance  the  highest  priorities  of  the  TEN-T  network,  and  focused  on  three  fields:</p>

</ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Air    traffic  management  systems  and  functional  airspace  blocks  (ATM/FABs)  &ndash;    four  projects  selected,  &euro;20.5  million  in  funding,  which  was  allocated  in    a  separate  call  published  on  16  February.</li>

It  is  focused  on  three  priorities:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Priority  1</strong>:  Promoting  the  development  of  an  integrated  and  environmentally  friendly    transport  system  as  well  as  studies  for  the  preparation  of  deployment    projects  contributing  to  the  addressing  of  climate  change  &ndash;  13  projects    selected,  &euro;32.1  million  in  funding.</li> 
</ul> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Priority  2</strong>:  Accelerating/facilitating  the  implementation  of  TEN-T  projects  (studies    for  all  modes,  works  for  mature  projects,  notably  in  the  rail  and    inland  waterways  sectors),  as  well  as  projects  supporting  the  Single    European  Sky  policy  &ndash;  18  projects  selected,  &euro;41.1  million  in  funding.</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>On  both  opportunities,  Mr  Cox  thanked  the  Austrian  and  Italian  authorities  involved  for  their  continuous  commitment.  He  welcomed  the  decision  to  launch  the  works  on  the  Brenner  Base  Tunnel  as  a  crucial  step  towards  realising  the  goal  of  a  modal  shift  from  road  to  rail  which  is  of  major  importance  for  the  alpine  region.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Until  2016,  Austria  will  invest  approximately  &euro;1.3  billion  in  the  tunnel  infrastructure.  Italy  too  authorised  the  launch  of  the  works  phase  with  a  financial  committment  that  guarantees  coverage  of  the  costs  over  the  entire  construction  period.  The  EU  foresees  investing  close  to  &euro;1  billion  in  the  Brenner  Corridor  by  the  end  of  2013.

<p>The  allocation  of  European  Union  funding  for  the  package  of  studies  will  fast  track  the  various  construction  phases  of  the  overall  development  of  the  undertaking.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Specifically,  four  individual  studies  are  planned:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<ul> 
<li>A  rail  infrastructure  study  to  estimate  the  costs  and  impact  of  constructing  a  new  1.27  km  rail  link  up  to  the  Manchester-Newton  le  Willows-Liverpool  railway  line  and  seven  775  m  reception  sidings</li> 
<li>A  wharf  infrastructure  study  to  estimate  the  costs  and  impact  of  constructing  a  new  quay  on  the  Manchester  Ship  Canal  offering  two  new  berths</li> 
<li>A  financial  validation  study  to  verify  the  costs  of  the  overall  Port  Salford  project  to  include  review  of  demand  and  competition</li> 
<li>A  study  to  carry  out  initial  preparation  (including  ground  and  surface  investigations)  to  assess  the  costs  associated  with  the  design,  building  and  operation  of  the  terminal  and  its  associated  warehousing  as  well  as  for  the  rail  and  waterway  improvement  schemes</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Once  finalised,  the  Port  Salford  project  will  add  to  the  competitiveness  of  local  businesses  by  significantly  reducing  the  costs  of  transporting  containers  to  the  Manchester  City  region.  Additionally,  around  2,000  people  will  be  employed  on  the  site.</p>

"112470002870285","1303133992","Green  light  for  Brenner  Base  Tunnel","Tunneling  to  start  on  key  project","","<p><strong>Vice-President  Siim  Kallas,  responsible  for  transport,  and  European  Coordinator  Pat  Cox  attended  today  a  ceremony  in  Innsbruck  to  launch  the  works  on  the  Brenner  Base  Tunnel.  The  Brenner  Base  Tunnel  is  a  low-gradient  rail  tunnel  with  two  parallel  tubes  between  Innsbruck  (Austria)  and  Fortezza  (Italy).  The  cross-border  tunnel  will  remove  a  major  bottleneck  for  both  freight  and  passenger  transit  between  Austria  and  Italy.  Vice-President  Kallas  welcomed  the  decision  taken  by  Austria  and  Italy  to  start  the  tunnelling  works  as  an  important  step  towards  more  resource-efficient  and  sustainable  transport  in  the  sensitive  alpine  region.</strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Today  Austria  and  Italy  officially  approved  the  launch  of  the  works  on  the  55  km  long  rail  tunnel.  This  decision  follows  agreement  between  the  two  countries  on  the  total  cost  and  financing  of  the  project.  The  total  cost  of  the  Brenner  Base  Tunnel  has  been  agreed  at  &euro;8  billion,  including  risk  provisions.  This  amount  includes  the  &euro;786  million  committed  by  the  EU  from  the  TEN-T  budget  during  the  financial  perspective  2007&ndash;13.  Overall,  the  EU  committed  &euro;1  billion  to  <a  id= "PAGE112470000000597 "  title= "Priority  Project  1 "  href= "javascript:void(0); ">Priority  Project  1</a>,  including  subsidies  to  the  European  Rail  Traffic  Management  System  (ERTMS).  The  tunnel  is  the  centrepiece  of  Priority  Project  1,  the  high-capacity  rail  axis  from  Berlin  to  Palermo  which  is  part  of  the  Trans-European  Transport  Network  (TEN-T).  When  connected  south  of  Innsbruck  with  the  already  existing  underground  bypass,  the  world's  longest  underground  railway  will  be  created,  with  a  total  length  of  64  km.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Excavation  works  on  the  exploratory  and  access  tunnels  already  started  in  2008  and  are  making  good  progress.  With  today's  decision,  works  on  the  main  tunnel  can  now  begin,  starting  from  Innsbruck  in  the  north  and  from  Fortezza  in  the  south.  As  from  2016  the  central  part  of  the  tunnel  between  Ahrental  and  Trens  will  be  excavated.  The  tunnel  is  scheduled  to  be  completed  in  2025.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Vice-President  Kallas  said:   "This  decision  marks  an  important  step  forward.  In  these  economically  difficult  times,  investing  in  a  sustainable  European  transport  policy  is  more  important  than  ever.  In  line  with  the  objectives  of  the  White  Paper  on  the  Future  of  Transport  the  Brenner  Base  Tunnel  will  deliver  a  crucial  contribution  for  rail  transport  to  play  its  part  in  more  resource  efficient  and  sustainable  alpine  transport.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Mr  Cox,  European  Coordinator  for  Priority  Project  1  and  former  President  of  the  European  Parliament,  added: "Today's  decision  reflects  the  progress  made  by  Austria  and  Italy  in  recent  months  as  well  as  by  the  Brenner  Corridor  Platform  and  other  stakeholders  since  the  start  of  this  important  TEN-T  Priority  Project.  It  is  a  tribute  to  all  those  who  have  worked  with  such  commitment  to  ensure  the  realisation  of  one  of  Europe&rsquo;s  major  future  rail  corridors.  I  would  also  like  to  use  this  opportunity  to  pay  tribute  to  my  predecessor,  the  late  Karel  Van  Miert,  who  was  instrumental  in  keeping  this  complex  process  moving  forward  at  every  stage.&rdquo;</p>

EU  support  will  be  devoted  to  the  development  and  installation  of  RIS  applications  and  infrastructure  in  waterways  and  in  ports  of  Antwerp  and  Gent.  Once  completed,  the  project  will  allow  for  faster  and  safer  transit  through  the  Flemish  inland  waterway  network  and  contribute  to  render  this  transport  mode  more  competitive.</strong></em></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  “Implementation  of  River  Information  Services  (RIS)  in  Flanders  II”  project  will  be  funded  by  the  EU  from  the  TEN-T  programme  to  the  tune  of  €0.59  million.  Its  main  overarching  objective  is  to  render  inland  waterway  navigation  in  the  Belgian  region  of  Flanders  more  competitive,  efficient  and  safe  for  both  freight  as  well  as  passengers.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p><a  id= "PAGE112470000511232 "  title= "RIS  (River  Information  Services) "  href= "javascript:void(0); ">River  Information  Services</a>  are  customised  information  services  for  inland  waterway  transport  that  make  it  possible  to  co-ordinate  logistical  processes  with  actual  transport  situations  on  a  constant  basis.  RIS  play  a  key  role  in  making  cargo  transport  and  passenger  services  on  waterways  more  efficient  and  ecologically  sound  while,  at  the  same  time,  increasing  traffic  safety.  RIS  Services  are  defined  by  a  European  Framework  Directive  and  need  to  be  implemented  by  the  Member  States  in  a  harmonised  way.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Some  basic  RIS  services  are  already  available  in  Flanders,  while  others,  like  Inland  Electronic  Navigation  Charts,  Notices  to  Skippers  and  Automatic  Identification  System  shore  infrastructure  are  about  to  be  installed.  However,  some  crucial  elements  necessary  to  benefit  from  the  full  effect  of  RIS  are  still  missing.  This,  coupled  with  an  ever  growing  demand  from  the  logistics  sector  to  be  able  to  use  and  exchange  RIS  information,  reinforces  the  importance  of  this  project  to  fluvial  mobility  in  the  region.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  Inland  waterway  sector  will  be  rendered  more  competitive  as  a  means  of  goods  and  passenger  transport.</p>

The  &ldquo;River  Information  Services  II  (RIS  II)&rdquo;  project  involves  equipping  barges  and  other  vessels  with  transponders  as  well  as  the  deployment  of  Automated  Identification  System  (AIS)  antennae  on  the  French  high  capacity  network  and  the  development  of  new  information  services.  This  aims  to  make  cargo  transport  and  passenger  services  on  inland  waterways  more  efficient  and  ecologically  sound  while,  at  the  same  time,  increasing  traffic  safety.</strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>River  Information  Services  (RIS)  are  customised  information  services  for  inland  waterway  transport  which  make  it  possible  to  co-ordinate  logistical  processes  with  actual  transport  situations  on  a  constant  basis.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This  RIS  II  project  builds  on  the  RIS  I  project,  which  was  also  financed  by  the  TEN-T  budget  to  set  up  pilot  installations  for  RIS.  Once  completed,  the  RIS  II  project  will  allow  for  the  real-time  collection  and  analysis  of  traffic  data  on  the  French  fluvial  network  offering  additional  services  to  vessel  owners,  logistic  operators  and  authorities.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In  the  framework  of  the  RIS  II  project,  transponders  will  be  installed  on  the  passenger  vessels  and  the  self-propelled  barges  on  the  French  high  gauge  waterway  network.  To  equip  the  entire  fleet,  the  need  is  estimated  at  1,360  transponders  for  the  next  three  years.  The  AIS  infrastructure  will  also  be  installed  on  all  transnational  waterways  of  class  IV  (capable  of  accommodating  vessels  of  a  tonnage  between  1,000  and  1,500  tons,  with  a  height  of  maximum  7  metres,  a  width  of  9.5  and  a  length  not  exceeding  85  metres)  and  above.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The  data  gathered  via  the  transponders  on  vessels  and  the  antennae  on  the  ground  will  be  collected  and  centralised  at  the  RIS  centre  and  used  to  create  new  services  based  on  the  actual  and  precise  location  of  vessels  in  the  river  and  canal  network  (e.g.  improved  calamity  abatement,  better  lock  management,  improved  navigability  instruments,  etc).</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>All  of  these  activities  will  increase  the  quality  of  service  of  inland  navigation  and  facilitate  modal  shift  towards  this  greener  means  of  transportation.</p>

"112470003264689","1347521468","Works  in  Progress:  Maastricht  urban  tunnel","Project  to  cut  road  traffic  in  Dutch  city  progressing  well","","<p><em><strong>The  city  of  Maastricht,  in  the  Netherlands,  is  currently  constructing  a  2.3  km  long  underground  tunnel  to  facilitate  connections  between  either  ends  of  the  city  and  reduce  traffic  levels.  The  project,  part  of  which  is  being  supported  by  the  European  Union  through  the  TEN-T  EA  to  the  tune  of  €12.7  million  (the  project  will  also  benefit  from  an  additional  €5  million  in  support  from  the  2011  Annual  Call,  bringing  the  total  to  €17.7  million),  will  remove  an  existing  bottleneck  on  the  A2  road  in  the  north-south  direction  by  augmenting  capacity  (lanes  will  be  increased  to  8,  4  in  each  direction  of  travel),  by  dividing  traffic  flows  between  regional  and  international  and  converting  the  road  into  a  real  motorway,  thus  reducing  travel  time.  In  addition,  the  project  will  boost  the  intermodal  connection  of  both  ports  and  airports  in  Maastricht  and  Liège.</strong></em></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  final  tunnel  will  be  a  two  level  tunnel  with  two  tubes  each.  Each  tube  will  have  two  lanes  of  traffic.  The  upper  level  will  connect  to  the  road  leading  south  to  Liège  or  north  to  Aachen,  whilst  the  lower  level  will  be  used  for  regional  traffic.  The  tunnel  will  function  as  a  real  motorway,  since  once  the  direction  will  be  selected  there  will  not  be  a  possibility  to  change.  Emergency  tunnels  for  evacuations  will  also  be  realised.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  part  of  the  project  co-financed  by  the  EU  is  the  realisation  of  the  first  400  metres  of  tunnel,  as  well  as  all  ancillary  works  such  as  setting  up  the  building  site,  deviating  technical  infrastructure  such  as  cables  and  sewers,  demolishing  parts  of  housing  estates  and  constructing  a  temporary  road  to  deviate  traffic  using  the  A2.  Tunnel  works  include  the  digging  of  a  trench  and  placing  concrete  sections  of  the  tunnel.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p><strong>State  of  play</strong></p> 
<p>Works  are  advanced  in  the  two  main  building  sites  of  the  project.  In  the  Koningsplain  area,  certain  tunnel  sections  have  already  been  covered  by  the  roof  and  some  technical  obstacles  (impossibility  to  demolish  a  building)  have  been  overcome.  Further  south,  in  the  Europaplein  area  (which  will  be  close  to  the  future  southern  access)  the  tunnel  levels  have  already  been  excavated  but  the  roof  still  needs  to  be  installed.  The  two  levels  of  the  future  tunnel  can  already  be  easily  identified  at  the  works  stage.</p> 
<p>The  tunnels  are  being  realised  using  the   "cut  and  cover "  technique,  a   simple  method  of  construction  for  shallow  tunnels  in  which  a  trench  is  excavated  and  roofed  over  with  an  overhead  support  system  strong  enough  to  carry  the  load  of  what  is  to  be  built  above  the  tunnel.  Since  the  entire  tunnel  will  be  only  18  metres  deep  on  average,  this  technique  was  deemed  more  appropriate.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p><strong>Future  impact</strong></p> 
<p>Due  to  the  urban  nature  of  the  project  the  works  to  dig  the  tunnel  have  caused  certain  inconveniencies  to  the  residents  and  businesses,  but  there  is  a  general  positive  feeling  regarding  the  project.  This  stems  mostly  from  the  future  benefits  which  the  tunnel  will  bring  to  Maastricht  and  its  citizens.  The  city,  in  fact,  has  one  of  the  highest  levels  of  air  pollution  in  the  Netherlands,  something  the  project  will  tackle,  alongside  noise  pollution.  The  project  will  also  contribute  to  social  and  economic  integration  of  a  city  which  is  currently  divided  in  two  by  the  A2  road  (west  and  east).  Thus,  some  marginalised  areas  will  be  revamped  by  being  better  integrated  into  the  city.  Pedestrians  and  cyclists  will  also  greatly  benefit  from  road  traffic  being  diverted  underground.  Finally,  a  special  green  belt  of  meadows  and  trees  will  be  realised  on  the  path  of  the  A2  road  once  the  tunnel  sections  are  finalised.  The  Groene  Loper,  as  it  will  be  called,  will  be  5  km  long  and  provide  a  clean  and  friendly  environment  right  in  the  heart  of  the  city.</p>

The  project,  which  was  presented  under  the  <a  id= "PAGE112470000470505 "  title= "Annual  Call  2010 "  href= "javascript:void(0); ">2010  TEN-T  Annual  Call</a>,  constitutes  an  essential  first  step  towards  a  possible  viable  deployment  of  open-access  infrastructure  for  electric  vehicles  across  the  EU  over  the  next  ten  years.</strong></em></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  project  will  combine  traditional  road  infrastructure,  Intelligent  Transport  Systems  (ITS)  services  and  an  original  electric  network  infrastructure  composed  of  battery  charging  stations,  powered  with  renewable  energy  sources  wherever  possible,  and  groundbreaking  fully-automated  battery  switching  stations.  Three  pilot  projects  will  run  in  The  Netherlands  and  Denmark,  allowing  for  urban  heavy  use,  long  distance  and  intermodal-switch  life-size  tests.  In  Amsterdam,  electric  taxis  will  ensure  their  duty  to  and  from  the  airport  (urban  context),  while  in  Copenhagen  and  Aarhus,  stations  will  be  positioned  next  to  highways  and  railways  to  enable  long  distance  and  intermodality  trials.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>In  parallel,  an  extensive  feasibility  study  addressing  conditions  for  service  concepts,  infrastructure  requirements  and  network  planning,  set  the  groundwork  for  the  standardised  mass  deployment  into  the  TEN-T  network  of  these  stations,  allowing  not  only  long  distance  travel,  but  also  transport  co-modality.  The  project  will  therefore  significantly  contribute  towards  more  sustainable,  economical  and  environmentally  friendly  transportation  alternatives  on  the  TEN-T  network  and  the  EU  as  a  whole.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  project  will  run  until  December  2012  and  involves  Denmark,  The  Netherlands,  Spain,  Austria,  Belgium  and  Luxembourg.</p>

<p> </p> 
<p>The  Port  of  Dunkirk  currently  faces  a  lack  of  deep-sea  berth  and  its  current  infrastructure  impedes  further  vessel  traffic  development  from  being  realised.  The  EU  funded  study  to  expand  the  port  will  help  pave  the  way  to  a  more  effective  facility  and  ensure  that  the  global  project  concerning  the  port’s  improvements  fulfils  design  and  environmental  requirements.  The  study  includes  design  data  collection,  design  studies,  maritime  studies  and  environmental  documentation.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>When  completed,  its  findings  will  be  relevant  to  the  broader  global  project  which  aims  to:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>create  two  new  perpendicular  basins  directly  linked  to  the  sea</li> 
<li>build  two  new  multimodal  terminals,  combining  road,  rail,  inland  waterway  transport  and  a  direct  link  to  the  sea,  one  on  each  side  of  the  new  basins</li> 
<li>connect  the  intermodal  terminals  to  the  transport  network.  The  basins  will  provide  a  direct  access  to  railway  and  inland  waterways</li> 
</ul> 
<p>The  global  project  will  contribute  to  the  optimisation  of  sustainable  modal  shift  by  incorporating  inland  waterways  and  rail.  It  will  also  assist  in  the  shift  of  freight  transportation  from  road  to  rail,  sea  and  waterborne  transport  leading  to  an  overall  reduction  of  emissions.</p>

<p> </p> 
<p>The  study,  which  fully  complies  fully  with  the  EU’s  strategy  for  the  Baltic  Sea  region  and  contributes  to  the  realisation  of  TEN-T  <a  id= "PAGE112470000000637 "  title= "Priority  Project  21 "  href= "javascript:void(0); ">Priority  Project  21</a>  (Motorways  of  the  Sea),  extends  from  the  Baltic  Sea  to  the  North  Sea  and  the  English  Channel.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>It  involves  LNG  (Liquefied  Natural  Gas)  filling  station  infrastructure  as  well  as  a  full  scale  pilot  action  as  the  main  components  of  the  project.  The  study  aims  at  creating  a  strategic  decision  paper  relevant  for  central  stakeholders  to  develop  framework  conditions  for  the  use  of  LNG  for  ships.  The  pilot,  on  the  other  hand,  will  see  the  modification  of  two  vessels  to  a  LNG  propulsion  system,  a  more  environmentally  friendly  system,  in  line  with  the  recent  requirements  of  the  International  Maritime  Organisation  (IMO)  for  Northern  Europe.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  pilot  action  will  be  followed  by  an  extensive  measurement  programme  for  validating  its  environmental  and  climate  benefits.  LNG  contains  no  sulphur  and  emits  90%  less  NOx  than  traditional  fuels  and  CO2  can  be  reduced  by  up  to  25%.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  lessons  learnt  from  the  project  are  foreseen  to  have  a  wider  benefit  for  other  geographical  areas  within  the  EU,  demonstrating  that  LNG  propulsion  is  a  viable  fuel  solution  for  large  vessels.</p>

<p>The  project,  which  was  selected  under  the  <a  id= "PAGE112470000470484 "  title= "River  Information  Services  (RIS)  Call  2010 "  href= "javascript:void(0); ">2010  TEN-T  Multi-Annual  Call</a>,  is  the  very  first  stage  of  Polish  RIS  deployment.  It  consists  of  the  preparation  of  a  RIS  feasibility  study  on  the  Lower  Oder  river  and  the  launch  of  its  related  pilot  scheme.  In  line  with  the  guidelines  set  up  in  the  RIS  Directive,  the  project  plans  to  test  an  interoperable,  reliable  and  safe  RIS  information  system  managed  from  a  new  Lower  Oder  RIS  Centre  to  be  constructed  and  based  in  the  Inland  Navigation  Office  of  Szczecin.  Testing  includes  looking  at  the  different  technical  specifications  to  reach  European  interoperability  and  include  Polish  inland  waterways  into  the  pan-European  RIS  network.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>EU  support  to  this  project  ensures  that  RIS  is  implemented  in  the  Polish  fluvial  network  at  greater  speed,  thus  enhancing  the  competitiveness  of  this  transport  mode  in  the  country  and  ensuring  the  harmonisation  of  Poland’s  river  network  with  the  rest  of  Europe.</p>

The  sector  aims  to  help  find  solutions  to  attract  more  private  sector  financing  and  to  contribute  to  the  improvement  of  the  management  of  the  TEN-T  programme  as  a  whole.</p>

<p> </p> 
<p>The  TEN-T  funded  project  involves  a  17.5  km  section  of  French  single-track  rail  infrastructure.  This  section  will  be  opened  tomorrow  to  commercial  passenger  traffic  for  the  first  time  in  over  30  years,  having  previously  only  been  used  for  freight  services.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  project  consisted  of  various  actions  aimed  at  modernising  the  rail  section,  notably:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Upgrading  the  line's  signalling  equipment;</li> 
<li>Strengthening  of  the  track  foundations  by  replacing  the  ballast  to  enable  continuous  speeds  of  up  to  90  km/h;</li> 
<li>Automation  of  three  level  crossings.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Once  all  the  ancillary  works  will  be  completed  in  December  2012,  travelling  times  on  the  section  will  be  shortened  by  10  minutes  and  speed  will  be  increased  from  70  to  90  km/h,  thus  rendering  rail  more  competitive  against  other  less  energy-efficient  transport  modes.  Starting  in  August  2013  high  speed  trains  between  Paris,  Lyon  or  the  Mediterranean  region  (Marseille,  Barcelona)  will  be  able  to  use  this  part  of  rail  infrastructure  to  transit  through  towards  Freiburg-im-Breisgau  in  Germany.</p>

This  will  constitute  a  link  in  the  future  European  express  rail  freight  network:  travelling  on  the  high  speed  lines  and  offering  a  viable  alternative  to  the  short-distance  intra-European  flights  and  to  express  road  freight.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  studies  will  cover  all  the  technical  and  financial  aspects,  which  will  create  the  basis  for  the  future  construction  works  of  the  Liège  Railport.  With  this  project,  Liège  takes  a  lead  role  in  the  Euro  CAREX  Network,  by  being  the  first  site  to  propose  the  finalisation  of  the  studies  and  the  concrete  implementation  of  the  intermodal  terminal.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  project  will  be  managed  by  the  Trans-European  Transport  Network  Executive  Agency  and  is  set  to  be  completed  by  November  2014.</p>

<p> </p> 
<p>This  line,  which  is  part  of  the  backbone  of  EU  transport  (TEN-T),  has  been  made  possible  with  support  from  the  cohesion  funds  of  the  EU,  with  an  investment  of  €3,500  million  (72%  of  the  project  on  the  Madrid-Barcelona)  and  the  line  of  support  TEN-T,  which  has  earmarked  €180  million,  concentrated  especially  in  cross-border  sections  and  intermodal  connections,  as  the  connection  to  the  port  of  Barcelona.

<p> </p> 
<p>The  project,  which  was  selected  for  funding  under  the  2011  TEN-T  Annual  Call,  involves  converting  the  existing   "Fjalir "  vessel  into  an  LNG  bunkering  ship.  It  will  be  used  for  providing  LNG  fuel  to  a  new  M/S  Viking  Grace  ferry  in  the  Port  of  Stockholm  and  later  also  to  other  ships.  This  bunkering  vessel  will  be  a  flexible  alternative  to  other  state  of  the  art  technologies  as  well  as  larger  scale,  land-  based  fuelling  infrastructure.  LNG  is  rapidly  emerging  as  a  more  environmentally  friendly  fuel  for  the  maritime  sector  and  its  uptake  is  encouraged  by  the  European  Union.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  bunkering  vessel  will  be  tested  with  1,000  tonnes  of  LNG,  corresponding  to  a  reduction  of  300  tonnes  of  CO2  and  10  tonnes  of  SO2  in  terms  of  equivalent  emissions  from  traditional  shipping  fuels.  The  test  results  will  be  measured  in  close  collaboration  with  the  Swedish  Transport  Agency  and  the  County  Administrative  Board,  whom  is  the  main  authority  in  charge  of  environmental  permits.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  results  will  enable  the  potential  of  such  a  bunkering  vessel  to  be  evaluated  as  well  as  the  need  for  future  permits  to  be  defined  with  regards  to  an  increasing  use  of  LNG  as  a  fuel  in  the  shipping  industry.</p>

<p> </p> 
<p>The  HIT  (Hydrogen  Infrastructure  for  Transport)  project,  which  was  selected  for  funding  under  the  2011  TEN-T  Annual  Call,  will  define  the  best  strategies  to  move  from  the  current  patchwork  of  hydrogen   "hotspots "  to  commercially  viable  for  Hydrogen  Refuelling  Stations  (HRS)  and  from  there  to  long  distance  transport  and  mobility  along  the  TEN-T  road  network.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  project  will  first  draft  four  National  Implementation  Plans  (NIP)  for  each  of  the  participating  countries  to  address  how  local  hydrogen   "hotspots "  can  be  turned  into  local  markets  with  a  sufficient  critical  mass  of  users  and  vehicles  and  integrated  into  the  TEN-T  road  network.  Three  pilots  will  then  be  conducted  to  examine  the  feasibility  of  long-distance  travel  between  major  HRS  stations  (Rotterdam,  Aalborg  and  Frederica)  using  hydrogen-fuelled  vehicles.  The  results  of  the  pilots  will  generate  valuable  information  which  will  be  used  for  drafting  the  NIP.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Finally,  a  proposal  for  the  deployment  of  hydrogen  as  a  long  distance  alternative  fuel  along  the  TEN-T  road  network  will  be  produced  by  integrating  the  results  of  the  NIP  and  the  three  pilots.  It  will  put  forward  recommendations  to  allow  policymakers  and  infrastructure  managers  to  develop  and  use  effective  support  schemes  for  a  viable  hydrogen  infrastructure  roll-out  in  the  European  Union.</p>

On  completion,  the  Port  will  be  able  to  attract  more  rail  operators  and  its  internal  operations  will  be  greatly  improved.</strong></em></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  project,  which  was  selected  for  funding  under  the  2011  TEN-T  Annual  Call,  involves  the  construction  and  adaptation  of  railway  tracks  in  UIC  gauge  from  the  current  Iberian  gauge.  It  consists  mainly  of  three  activities:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Connection  of  the  Prat  container  terminal  to  the  internal  railway  network  of  the  Port  of  Barcelona,  including  the  adaptation  to  UIC  gauge  the  already  existing  tracks</li> 
<li>Adaptation  of  the   "Contrabucle "  rail  section  to  UIC  gauge</li> 
<li>Adaptation  of  the  railway  terminal  in  Moll  de  l'Energia  to  UIC  gauge.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Adaptation  to  UIC  gauge  will  be  done  via  the  insertion  of  a  third  rail  track  between  the  two  existing  ones  (UIC  gauge  is  narrower  than  the  Iberian  one).</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Once  finalised,  the  project  will  allow  the  Port  to  improve  its  internal  rail  operations  (better  reliability  and  less  time)  and  to  contribute  to  the  modal  shift  from  road  to  rail  (and  thus  lowering  the  environmental  impact  of  the  Port  itself).  It  will  also  allow  seamless  rail  convoy  traffic  in  UIC  gauge  between  the  various  wharves  and  ensure  the  Port  is  directly  connected,  via  rail,  to  France.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  project  is  set  to  be  completed  by  June  2013.</p>

<p>The  final  project,  co-financed  to  the  tune  of  €1.7  million,  involves  the  modernisation  of  the  Wintam  to  Willebroek  section  of  the  Brussels-Scheldt  canal.  The  latter  is  part  of  the  TEN-T  network  and  is  located  at  the  crossroads  of  various  important  road  and  rail  connections.  The  project  will  support  upgrading  the  section  to  obtain  a  minimum  water  depth  of  9.5  metres  and  a  minimum  width  of  55  metres,  in  order  to  make  it  accessible  to  vessels  displacing  up  to  10,000  tonnes  and  stimulate  inland  waterway  transport  in  the  region.</p>

The  project  will  receive  €5  million  in  contribution  to  ensure  that  one  of  the  bottlenecks  currently  restricting  capacity  at  the  port  is  removed.</strong></em></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  aim  of  the  project,  which  was  selected  for  funding  under  the  2011  TEN-T  Annual  Call,  is  to  build  a  sea  lock  in  the  Port  of  Antwerp,  one  of  northern  Europe's  busiest  ports.  The  new  lock  will  create  a  new  connection  between  the  tidal  Deurganckdock  and  the  non-tidal  docks  of  Waaslandhaven.  The  dimensions  of  the  new  lock  will  be  the  same  as  those  of  the  Berendrecht  lock,  located  on  the  right  bank  of  the  Scheldt  river,  which  is  currently  the  biggest  sea  lock  in  the  world.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  lock  will  be  68  metres  wide  and  500  metres  long,  with  a  depth  of  17.8  metres.  It  will  be  equipped  with  four  rolling  gates  and  four  moveable  bridges  will  be  constructed  to  deviate  road  and  rail  traffic  over  the  lock.  An  operating  centre  for  all  parts  of  the  lock  complex  and  several  technical  buildings  will  also  be  constructed  as  part  of  the  project.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Thanks  to  this  lock,  the  capacity  of  the  port  to  handle  additional  vessels  and  better  manage  their  distribution  will  be  improved.  The  new  infrastructure  will  reduce  delays  for  entering  and  leaving  the  Waaslandhaven,  increase  operational  reliability,  allow  larger  ships  to  enter,  optimise  the  use  of  the  available  port  infrastructure  and  increase  safety  by  creating  a  second  entrance/exit  to  the  Waaslandhaven,  yielding  benefits  to  the  entire  European  shipping  sector.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>EU  support  will  last  until  December  2014,  and  the new  lock  basin  is  expected  to  enter  into  service  by  March  2016.</p>

<p> </p> 
<p>The  aim  of  the  project,  which  was  selected  for  funding  under  the  2011  TEN-T  Annual  Call  is  twofold.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>First  it  aims  to  support  and  accelerate  the  implementation  of  A-CDM  processes  at  11  selected  European  airports.  Eurocontrol,  which  is  implementing  the  project,  will  also  look  beyond  this  first  batch  of  airports  with  the  target  of  deploying  A-CDM  in  a  number  of  other  airports  by  2014.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>As  a  second  activity,  the  project  will  support  the  acceleration  of  collaborative  civil-military  ASM  solutions  to  ensure  an  optimal  use  of  airspace.  This  will  be  achieved  through  the  deployment  by  Eurocontrol  of  a  new  ASM  coordination  tool  at  the  rate  of  four  EU  countries  per  year.  A  specific  objective  concerns  the  procurement  of  the  related  software  and  hardware  in  The  Netherlands  and  in  Romania,  thereby  allowing  the  flexible  use  of  airspace.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  project  is  set  to  be  completed  by  the  end  of  2014.</p>

<p> </p> 
<p>The  projects,  which  were  selected  for  funding  under  the  2011  TEN-T  Annual  Call,  will  support  the  upgrade  of  three  key  sub-sections  of  the  railway  line  between  Vienna  and  Salzburg,  helping  to  alleviate  problematic  bottlenecks.  These  upgrades  will  ultimately  increase  capacity,  speed  and  frequency  of  rail  traffic  on  the  lines  -  shortening  travelling  times,  reducing  noise  pollution  and  helping  to  encourage  a  modal  shift  to  rail.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  first  project,  which  will  receive  just  under  €5  million  in  co-financing,  covers  works  on  a  sub-section  to  the  west  of  Amstetten  Station.  Actions  covered  include  laying  the  foundations  for  the  works,  constructing  a  road  underpass  and  overpass,  and  laying  the  new  tracks.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  second  project  will  receive  just  over  €2.5  million  in  EU  funding  and  covers  the  upgrade  of  a  sub-section  of  track  between  Lambach  and  Breitenschützing.  In  addition  to  laying  the  new  track,  the  works  to  be  carried  out  includes  hydraulic  and  civil  engineering  works,  construction  of  ancillary  roads,  bridges,  platforms  and  noise  protection  walls  and  the  installation  of  signalling  equipment.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  final  project  will  receive  €5  million  of  EU  co-financing  and  covers  a  section  in  the  area  of  St  Pölten.  The  project  involves  the  construction  of  a  new  double  track  freight  line,  including  foundations,  drainage  works,  noise  protection  walls  and  associated  roads.  The  new  line  will  bypass  the  town  of  St  Pölten  before  joining  up  to  the  existing  upgraded  high  speed  line.</p>

The  project,  which  will  also  enlarge  a  section  of  the  Canal,  benefits  from  a  TEN-T  Programme  contribution  of  over  €3  million  and  is  part  of  a  wider  series  of  improvements  on  the  Albert  Canal  to  allow  for  increased  container  traffic.</strong></em></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  Albert  Canal,  the  most  important  waterway  in  the  Belgian  region  of  Flanders,  has  a  transport  capacity  of  ±40  million  tonnes  (mostly  in  the  form  of  container  traffic),  connecting  the  cities  of  Antwerp  and  Liège,  and  the  Scheldt  and  Meuse  rivers.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>In  order  to  improve  this  key  infrastructure,  and  in  light  of  the  forecasted  increases  in  container  traffic,  the  European  Commission  decided  to  fund  this  action  under  the  2011  TEN-T  Annual  Call.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  raising  of  these  bridges,  which  will  be  completed  by  the  end  of  2014,  is  a  key  step  in  upgrading  the  Albert  Canal  so  that  it  can  accommodate  more  traffic  in  the  years  to  come  and  hence  contribute  towards  a  modal  shift  from  more  polluting  means  of  transportation.  Furthermore,  widening  the  Canal  between  Wijnegem  and  Antwerp  will  allow  Class  VI  vessels  (ships  up  to  280  metres  long  and  just  under  35  metres  wide)  to  navigate  it  in  its  entirety,  from  Antwerp  to  Liège.</p>

The  projects  focus  on  establishing  fully  operational  rail  freight  corridors  as  required  by  EU  Regulation  913/2010,  providing  optimal  rail  freight  transport  and  increasing  rail  transport  competitiveness  across  the  EU.</strong></em></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  four  projects  were  selected  for  funding  under  the  2011  TEN-T  Annual  Call.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  first,  which  will  receive  €1.3  million  in  EU  co-financing,  will  prepare  the  managerial  structures  and  activities  needed  to  establish  Rail  Freight  Corridor  2,  a  trans-national  rail  freight  axis  starting  in  Rotterdam  (The  Netherlands)  and  then,  via  Belgium,  Luxembourg  and  France,  reaching  Basel  (Switzerland)  and  Lyon  (France).</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  second  project,  which  will  receive  just  over  €1.6  million  in  EU  co-financing,  covers  the  preparatory  studies  and  activities  needed  for  the  organisation  of  Rail  Freight  Corridor  8.  This  axis  runs  from  the  key  ports  of  Bremerhaven  (Germany),  Rotterdam  (The  Netherlands)  and  Antwerp  (Belgium)  to  Kaunas  (Lithuania),  crossing  northern  Europe  on  an  east-west  path.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  third  project,  receiving  nearly  €1.7  million  in  EU  support,  concerns  the  establishment  of  Rail  Freight  Corridor  6,  which  runs  along  the  south  of  Europe  from  Almeria  and  Madrid  in  Spain  to  Záhony  in  Hungary,  crossing  France,  Italy  and  Slovenia.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  final  project  will  receive  just  over  €1  million  in  EU  co-financing  to  prepare  the  implementation  of  Rail  Freight  Corridor  4,  which  runs  from  Lisbon,  Sines  and  Leixões  (Portugal)  to  Algeciras,  Madrid,  Bilbao,  San  Sebastián  and  Irun  (Spain)  and  all  the  way  up  through  Paris  and  into  northern  and  eastern  France.  The  project  will  undertake  the  required  analyses  for  the  freight  corridor  and  prepare  the  implementation  plan.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Establishing  the  managerial  and  operational  structures  of  these  four  rail  corridors  is  of  paramount  importance  as  they  will  have  to  coordinate  and  bring  together  all  the  relevant  stakeholders  to  ensure  an  improved  rail  freight  flow  along  each  individual  corridor,  to  enhance  the  interoperability  and  to  foster  cooperation  among  the  Rail  Freight  Corridors.</p>

The  projects  will  help  to  increase  capacity  on  two  important  sections  of  this  key  rail  corridor.</strong></em></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Both  projects  were  selected  for  funding  under  the  2011  TEN-T  Annual  Call.  The  first  one,  which  will  receive  just  under  €1.5  million  in  EU  funding,  consists  of  studies  concerning  the  construction  of  a  new  line  between  Stångån  and  Dingersjö.  The  2.8  km  rail  line  is  part  of  the  new  double  track  Gävle-Sundsvall  rail  section  and  the  project's  outcome  will  be  key  studies  as  well  as  the  necessary  documents  needed  for  the  tendering  procedure  to  construct  the  new  line,  planned  for  2015-2017.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  second  project,  which  will  receive  over  €2  million  in  EU  co-financing,  concerns  the  construction  of  three  new  750  m  long  meeting  stations  along  the  Bothnian  Corridor  at  Källene,  Stegskogen  and  Gårdsjön.  Completion  of  the  new  stations  will  increase  the  reliability  of  the  Swedish  East  Coast  Line,  with  fewer  delays  and  higher  capacity.  The  planned  signalling  system  for  the  new  stations  will  also  allow  a  more  fluid  traffic  management.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  improvements  resulting  from  both  projects  will  help  the  Gävle-Sundsvall  line  to  accommodate  existing  and  expected  future  traffic  increases.  Both  projects  will  be  managed  by  the  Trans-European  Transport  Network  Executive  Agency,  with  the  first  one  set  to  be  complete  by  December  2014  and  the  second  by  December  2013.</p>

The  high  tech  centre  will  further  advance  the  air  transport  infrastructure  of  both  Hungary  and  Central  Europe  as  a  whole,  contributing  to  the  continued  competitiveness  of  the  Hungarian  air  navigation  services.  The  opening  ceremony  was  held  in  the  presence  of  representatives  from  the  European  Commission,  EUROCONTROL,  the  Trans-European  Transport  Network  Executive  Agency  (TEN-T  EA)  and  the  Hungarian  government.</strong></em></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  project,  called  ANS  III,  is  a  key  component  of  the  complex  development  programme  sponsored  by  HungaroControl  to  strengthen  Air  Traffic  Management  (ATM)  efficiency  and  to  ensure  that  the  Hungarian  air  navigation  service  provider  meets  the  European  Union's  performance  objectives.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>It  involved  building  a  state  of  the  art  ATM  control  centre  with  the  potential  to  implement  cutting  edge  technologies  and  to  provide  efficient  services  to  civil  aviation.  The  European  Union  supported  the  project  via  its  TEN-T  Programme  and  with  a  €6  million  grant  managed  through  the  TEN-T  EA.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  new  ATM  centre  is  equipped  with  high  quality  innovative  equipment  and  software,  such  as  the  MATIAS  air  navigation  and  communication  system  -  recognised  across  the  world  and  developed  with  the  participation  of  Hungarocontrol,  the  Hungarian  air  navigation  service  provider  (ANSP).  The  opening  of  ANS  III  provides  the  opportunity  for  HungaroControl  to  centralise  its  research  and  innovation  efforts  at  a  single  location,  thus  creating  a  state-of-the-art  air  navigation  research,  development  and  simulation  knowledge  centre.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Mr  <strong>Frank  Brenner</strong>,  Director  General  of  EUROCONTROL  praised  the  ANS  III  project,  stating  that  it   "demonstrates  a  strong  commitment  on  Hungary's  and  HungaroControl's  side  to  contribute  to  the  development  of  the  European  ATM  network  and  the  Single  European  Sky  while  serving  the  needs  of  airspace  users  in  an  efficient  manner ".  The  transition  to  the  new  system  was  conducted  successfully  and  in  close  co-operation  with  EUROCONTROL,  causing  no  delays  to  airlines.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Hungarian  Minister  of  National  Development,  Ms  <strong>Zsuzsa  Németh</strong>  stressed  that  in  order  to   set  the  economy  of  the  European  Union  onto  a  path  of  growth,  strengthening  economic,  social  and  spatial  integration  is  a  must  and  transportation  development  is  a  tool  to  achieve  it.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>TEN-T  EA  Executive  Director  <strong>Dirk  Beckers</strong>  praised  HungaroControl  and  all  the  other  actors  involved  in  the  project's  realisation,  mentioning  the  importance  of  EU  support  in  stimulating  the  realisation  of  important  infrastructure  projects  across  the  European  Union.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Kornél  Szepessy,  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  HungaroControl,  further  stated  that   "Investments  in  the  ANS  III  Programme  fit  organically  into  the  objectives  set  by  the  Single  European  Sky  initiative,  assisting  the  highest  possible  technical/technological  operating  quality  of  the  Central  European  functional  airspace  block.  Additionally,  developments  at  HungaroControl  ensure  in  the  long  run  that  the  Hungarian  air  navigation  service  provider  belongs  at  the  forefront  of  European  technical  and  technological  advancement. "</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  new  ATM  centre  is  already  operational  in  the  Hungarian  airspace.  Following  handover  from  NATO/KFOR  it  is  aiming  to  manage  the  upper  airspace  over  Kosovo  in  co-operation  with  international  stakeholders.</p>

"112470005608937","1363354608","Works  in  Progress:  A  new  inland  waterway  network  for  northern  Italy","significant  progress  in  key  Inland  Waterway  project","","<p><em><strong>The  project  supported  by  the  TEN-T  Programme  will  contribute  to  the  upgrade  of  the  northern  Italian  inland  waterway  network  (the  Po  river  and  its  canals)  to  class  Va  (capable  of  accommodating  vessels  up  to  110  metres  long  and  displacing  3,000  tonnes  with  3  layers  of  containers  loaded).</strong></em></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Additionally  it  will  also  develop  the  multimodal  interconnections  with  the  existing  road  and  rail  networks  as  well  as  the  Adriatic  Sea  (Short  Sea  Shipping  and  South  East  Europe  Motorways  of  the  Sea  –  TEN-T  Priority  Project  21).  The  ultimate  objective  is  to  increase  the  capacity  of  the  northern  Italian  waterway  system  to  meet  existing  and  future  demand  for  freight  transport  in  this  heavily  industrialised  and  congested  region  of  Italy.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p><strong>What  is  being  realised</strong></p> 
<p>The  project  focuses  on  upgrading  the  connection  between  Mantova  and  its  industrial  zone  to  the  Adriatic  Sea  along  the  Fissero-Tartaro-Canal  Bianco  and  Po-Brondolo  segments.</p> 
<p>This  will  be  achieved  by:</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Building  new  locks  at  Brondolo  and  Cavanella  to  provide  class  Va  infrastructure  and  allow  larger  vessels  to  safely  use  the  locks  and  continue  navigating  on  the  canalSetting  up  an  automated  and  remote  control  system  for  the  lock  chambers  in  the  Veneto  segment  so  as  to  increase  the  efficiency,  speed,  safety  and  competitiveness  of  inland  waterway  navigation.Building  a  new  lock  chamber  in  the  area  of  Valdaro  in  order  to  connect  the  industrial  zone  of  the  lakes  of  Mantova  to  the  Adriatic  sea  .Improving  the  structures,  performance  and  accessibility  and  hinterland  connection  of  the  Mantova  Valdaro  port,  thereby  strengthening  its  capacity  to  serve  as  an  ideal  inland  waterway  transport  intermodal  node.Building  a  new  road  connection  between  the  Mantova  port  and  the  A22  Brennero  Motorway.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p><em><strong>Current  status</strong></em></p> 
<p>The  Brondolo  lock  has  been  fully  built  and  nearly  all  the  additional  works  foreseen  in  this  activity  have  been  completed.  The  lock  is  not  yet  operational  because  some  dredging  works  still  have  to  take  place.  The  chamber  locks  at  Cavanella  and  the  automation  and  remote  control  system  for  the  locks  in  the  Veneto  region  are  completed  and  operational.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  new  Valdaro  lock  chamber  has  been  built,  but  is  not  yet  operational  awaiting  a  depollution  operation,  final  dredging  works  and  the  installation  of  the  remote  control  system  and  operation  cabin.  Similarly  the  works  in  the  Mantova  Valdaro  port  have  advanced  steadily  during  2012  and  only  small  additional  works  remain  to  be  completed.</p> 
<p>Construction  of  the  railway  overpass  and  the  connection  of  the  Mantova  port  and  the  A22  Brennero  Motorway  have  been  suspended  as  the  implementing  body  needs  to  republish  the  tender  for  these  works,  which  are  unlikely  to  be  completed  before  the  end  of  2014.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p><em><strong>TEN-T  involvement</strong></em></p> 
<p>The  project  started  in  May  2009.  The  TEN-T  programme  is  contributing  10%  –  or  a  maximum  of  €8,172,300  –  of  the  total  cost  of  the  works,  with  the  rest  of  the  money  coming  from  the  Italian  State.  The  total  cost  of  the  works  being  realised  should  ultimately  be  €81,723,000  and  the  project  should  be  completed  by  December  2013.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p><em><strong>Expected  benefits</strong></em></p> 
<p>Completion  of  the  project  is  expected  to  lead  to  an  improvement  in  the  accessibility  of  the  industrial  pole  of  southeast  Lombardy,  to  foster  the  interoperability  of  the  Valdaro  port  area  with  road  and  rail  networks  and  to  increase  the  efficiency  and  safety  of  navigation.  The  project  will  deliver  a  greatly  improved  inland  waterway  network  in  northern  Italy  and  guarantee  connections  to  intermodal  nodes,  ports  and  road  and  rail  networks  in  a  key  geographical  region  situated  at  the  crossing  of  two  key  TEN-T  Priority  Projects:  the  railway  axis  Berlin-Verona/Milano-Bologna-Napoli-Messina-Palermo  (Priority  Project  1)  and  the  railway  axis  Lyon-Trieste-Divaèa/Koper-Divaèa-Ljubljana-Budapest-Ukrainian  border  (Priority  Project  6).</p>

</ul> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  2012  Annual  Programme  Call  gave  financing  for  a  large  number  of  smaller  projects  covering  the  different  modes  of  transport.  This  Call  granted  €247.20  million  in  total  funding  in  four  main  priority  areas:</p> 
<p> </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Priority  1  -  Acceleration/facilitation  of  the  implementation  of  TEN-T  projects  (inland  waterways,  multimodal,  maritime,  rail,  road)  –  67  projects  selected,  €211.36  million  in  funding</li>

<p> </p> 
<p>The  study,  selected  for  funding  under  the  2011  TEN-T  Annual  Programme's  priority  on  new  technologies  for  transport  infrastructure,  will  look  at  solutions  to  implement  a  standardised  onshore  electrical  power  supply  in  the  Port  of  Hamburg  (Germany).  This  will  allow  ships  at  berth  to  draw  their  power  needs  directly  from  the  grid,  rather  than  having  their  auxiliary  engines  running  to  produce  electricity.</p>

The  concerned  section,  also  part  of  PP19,  is  located  between  Castellbisbal  and  Nud  de  Vilaseca  near  Tarragona.  The  works  cover  the  necessary  adaptations  on  the  installations  and  line  elements  for  the  operation  of  750  m  long  trains  in  mixed  Iberian/UIC  gauge.  They  will  be  carried  out  along  90  km  of  double  track  and  7  km  of  single  track,  allowing  the  access  to  the  Port  of  Tarragona  in  UIC  gauge.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  project  will  contribute  to  fostering  interoperability  and  intermodality  in  the  Spanish  rail  network,  ultimately  making  rail  transport  more  economically  viable  for  commercial  operators.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Both  initiatives  will  be  monitored  by  the  Trans-European  Transport  Network  Executive  Agency  (TEN-T  EA)  and  are  set  to  be  completed  by  2014  and  2015  respectively.</p>

<p> </p> 
<p>The  project,  selected  under  the  2012  TEN-T  Annual  Programme,  foresees  the  expansion  and  upgrading  works  of  the  port  rail  infrastructure  in  Bremerhaven.  Specifically,  the  Kaiserhafen  railway  station  will  be  upgraded  by  lengthening  11  tracks  to  a  working  length  of  700  to  750  metres.  Two  additional  entrance  tracks  to  the  station  will  also  be  electrified  as  part  of  the  project.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Additional  shunting  tracks  will  also  be  installed  in  the  Imsumer  Deich,  in  direct  vicinity  to  the  container  sea  terminals.  To  this  end,  an  expansion  of  the  container  train  handling  area  with  the  installation  of  8  new  and  fully  electrified  tracks  (working  length  of  750  metres)  will  increase  the  railway  capacity  for  container  trains  near  the  terminals  by  around  50%.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Realisation  of  these  works  will  produce  positive  environmental  effects  due  to  reduced  emissions  in  the  port  and  the  hinterland,  as  well  as  the  possible  modal  shift  from  road  to  rail.</p>

<p> </p> 
<p>The  first  project,  selected  under  the  2012  TEN-T  Annual  Programme,  will  receive  €8.1  million  to  upgrade  the  Orte-Falconara  line,  linking  the   "Railway  axis  Berlin-Verona/Milano-Bologna-Napoli-Messina-Palermo "  (<a  id= "PAGE112470000000597 "  title= "Priority  Project  1 "  href= "javascript:void(0); ">TEN-T  Priority  Project  1</a>)  to  the  Adriatic  Main  Line.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Specifically,  it  includes  completion  of  the  works  to  double  the  track  on  the  two  following  sections:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Spoleto-Campello  (total  length  of  roughly  10  km).  The  new  line  will  run  partly  alongside  the  existing  railway  and  partly  along  a  new  alignment  through  an  artificial  tunnel.  This  section  also  includes  some  improvements  to  the  Spoleto  Station  and  the  transformation  of  the  Campello  station  into  a  stop.</li> 
<li>Castelplanio-Montecarotto  (total  length  of  6.2  km).  Works  also  include  some  improvements  to  the  Castelplanio  and  Montecarotto  stations.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Completion  of  these  works  will  contribute  to  the  overall  elimination  of  bottlenecks  along  the  route  and  bring  socio-economic  benefits  to  the  region.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  second  project,  also  selected  for  funding  under  the  2012  TEN-T  Annual  Programme,  will  receive  almost  €6.6  million  of  co-financing  to  double  a  section  from  Lunghezza  to  Guidonia,  including  some  works  at  the  Bagni  di  Tivoli  stop  and  the  Guidonia  Collefiorito  station,  as  well  as  some  elements  of  the  new  Ponte  di  Nona  stop.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>As  a  result  of  the  works,  the  rail  capacity  in  the  highly  populated  metropolitan  area  of  Rome  will  be  increased,  leading  to  more  efficient  and  effective  rail  transport  overall.</p> 
<p> </p>

The  project  will  improve  the  safety  of  rail  transport  whilst  at  the  same  time  making  the  sector  more  competitive.</em></strong></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  project,  selected  under  the  2012  TEN-T  Multi-Annual  Call  which  gave  priority  to  ERTMS,  is  a  component  of  the  Danish  migration  strategy  to  ERTMS  (ETCS  Level  2,  Baseline  3)  on  its  conventional  railway  lines.  ERTMS  is  a  major  European  industrial  initiative  to  make  rail  transport  safer  and  more  competitive.  Its  goal  is  to  substitute  more  than  20  different  train  control-command  systems  which  are  currently  in  use  in  Europe  with  a  single  harmonised  system.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  project  contributes  to  the  migration  by  deploying  new  signalling  systems  (hardware  and  software)  on  the  154  km  long  Langaa–Frederikshavn  line,  a  mixed  traffic  line  of  double  and  single  track  which  is  part  of  the  Danish  TEN-T  rail  network.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Once  finalised,  the  project  is  expected  to  increase  the  efficiency  and  the  interoperability  of  the  Danish  conventional  railway  network.</p>

<p> </p> 
<p>Commission  Vice  President  Siim  Kallas,  responsible  for  transport,  commented:    "With  the  2007-2013  budgetary  period  coming  to  an  end,  we  will  make  the  best  possible  use  of  these  TEN-T  Calls  for  Proposals  to  make  sure  European  transport  infrastructure  supports  a  seamless  mobility  of  goods  and  people  throughout  the  European  Union.  I  am  confident  that  these  calls  will  elicit  great  interest  throughout  the  EU,  as  Member  States  realise  the  importance  of  investing  today  for  tomorrow's  growth  and  jobs.

<p> </p> 
<p>TheTEN-T  multi-annual  programme  traditionally  finances  the  highest  priorities  of  the  TEN-T  network.  This  year's  multi-annual  calls,  the  last  ones  to  be  held  under  the  2007-2013  budget,  focus  on  five  fields,  with  €280  million  of  total  indicative  budget  available:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The  30  TEN-T  Priority  Projects  (with  the  exception  of  MoS):  indicative  budget  €50  million.</li> 
<li>Motorways  of  the  Sea  (MoS)  providing  viable  alternatives  for  congested  roads  by  shifting  freight  to  sea  routes:  indicative  budget  €80  million.</li> 
<li>European  Rail  Traffic  Management  Systems  (ERTMS),  enabling  interoperability  on  the  European  rail  network:  indicative  budget  €70  million.</li> 
<li>Air  Traffic  Management  (ATM),  implementing  the  Single  European  Sky  and  ATM  modernisation  objectives:  indicative  budget  €30  million.</li> 
<li>Intelligent  Transport  Systems  (ITS),  promoting  interoperability  and  continuity  of  real  time  traffic  and  travel  information  services  across  Europe  towards  a  safer  and  more  efficient  road  network:  indicative  budget  €50  million.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>The  annual  programme  complements  the  multi-annual  one  and  for  2013  directs  funding  to  two  distinct  priorities  with  a  total  indicative  budget  of  €70  million: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Acceleration/facilitation  of  the  implementation  of  TEN-T  projects  (studies  and  works  for  mature  projects  for  all  modes,  as  part  of  the  projects  of  common  interest):  indicative  budget€20  million.</li> 
<li>Measures  to  promote  and  develop  innovative  solutions  and  new  technologies  in  areas  such  as:  alternative  fuels  infrastructure,  sustainability  of  urban  mobility,  traffic  efficiency, decarbonisation,  noise  reduction,  and  safety  (e.g.  vehicle-infrastructure  communication  systems):  indicative  budget€50  million.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>The  TEN-T  Executive  Agency  (TEN-T  EA)  manages  the  technical  and  financial  implementation  of  the  TEN-T  programme,  under  the  auspices  of  Directorate-General  for  Mobility  and  Transport.  The  TEN-T  EA  will  hold  an  Info  Day  on  Friday  13  December  2013  in  Brussels  to  help  potential  applicants  better  understand  the  call  priorities,  prepare  their  proposals  and  learn  about  the  evaluation  process.</p>

INEA  is  the  successor  of  the  TEN-T  EA  (Trans-European  Transport  Network  Executive  Agency,  which  was  created  by  the  European  Commission  in  2006  to  manage  the  technical  and  financial  implementation  of  its  TEN-T  Programme.</strong></em></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p><strong>What  is  an  Executive  Agency?</strong></p> 
<p>Executive  Agencies  of  the  European  Commission  turns  EU  policy  into  action  by  overseeing  programme  implementation.  This  means  they  follow  EU  co-funded  projects  throughout  their  lifecycle,  providing  valuable  feedback  to  the  Commission  in  the  process.  This  is  in  addition  to  giving  a  wide  variety  of  support  to  the  programme  beneficiaries  and  ensuring  good  visibility  on  the  added-value  of  EU  funding.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p><strong>What  is  INEA's  role?</strong></p> 
<p>INEA  will  manage  parts  of  the  new  <span  style= "color:  #993366; ">Connecting  Europe  Facility  (CEF)</span>  and<span  style= "color:  #993366; ">  Horizon2020  programme</span>.  The  CEF  is  a  key  EU  financial  instrument  to  promote  growth,  jobs  and  competitiveness  through  targeted  infrastructure  investment  at  European  level.  It  is  divided  into  three  main  areas:</p> 
<p>•  CEF  Transport</p> 
<p>•  CEF  Energy </p> 
<p>•  CEF  Digital </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>It  will  also  manage  two  parts  of  Horizon  2020,  the  EU's  main  financial  instrument  for  the  research  area.  The  Smart  green  and  integrated  transport and  Secure,  clean  and  efficient  energy are  part  of  H2020's   "Better  Society "  objective  tackling  societal  challenges  shared  by  all  Europeans.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>In  total,  it  is  expected  that  the  Agency  will  manage  a  budget  of  up  to  €37  billion  for  the  new Programmes  (€30  billion  from  the  CEF  and  €7  billion  from  H2020).</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Last  but  not  least,  INEA  will  continue  to  manage  the  remaining  2007-2013  TEN-T  Programme  projects,  as  well  as  the  remaining  projects  from  the  Marco  Polo  Programme  (freight  logistics),  which  it  takes  over  from  the  Executive  Agency  for  Competitiveness  and  Innovation.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>INEA,  based  in  Brussels,  has  a  current  staff  of  105  which  will  increase  as  it  takes  on  its  new  responsibilities.</p>

<p>The  studies,  selected  for  funding  under  the  2012  TEN-T  Multi-Annual  Programme,  will  assess,  install,  demonstrate  and  evaluate  a  new  generation  of  innovative  lightweight  scrubber  technology  on  two  existing  ro-ro  vessels  operating  in  the  Baltic  and  North  Sea.  Three  EU  Member  States  –  Sweden,  Finland  and  The  Netherlands  –  will  work  together  to  verify  and  evaluate  the  specific  port  infrastructure  and  preparatory  investments  needed  for  full  scale  implementation  of  this  technology.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  studies  will  also  investigate  how  a  financial  mechanism  can  be  set  up  in  order  to  support  ship  owners/operators  adopting  the  new  technology  and  give  recommendations  to  decision-makers  on  how  to  implement  this  mechanism.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Dissemination  of  results  and  best  practices  will  provide  guidance  to  the  shipping  community  and  will  assist  on  how  to  choose  optimum  Sulphur  Emission  Control  Area  (SECA)  compliance  strategies.</p>

<p> </p> 
<p>The  study,  which  was  selected  for  funding  under  the  2012  TEN-T  Annual  Programme,  will  look  at  different  options  to  renovate  and  reconstruct  the  Royers  Lock,  which  links  the  tidal  Scheldt  river  with  the  Port  of  Antwerp  and  the  Albert  Canal.  The  outdated  lock  requires  constant  maintenance  and  causes  disruptions  to  inland  vessels  using  the  Port  of  Antwerp  and  its  hinterland.  The  outcome  of  the  study  will  directly  lead  to  the  beginning  of  the  construction  phase  in  2016,  which,  once  completed,  will  stimulate  the  use  of  inland  waterway  as  an  alternative  means  of  transport  for  freight  in  the  region  and  beyond.</p>

<p> </p> 
<p>The  project,  which  was  selected  for  funding  under  the  2012  TEN-T  Multi-Annual  Call,  is  the  first  phase  of  a  larger  initiative  aimed  at  upgrading  the  Novara  Intermodal  Terminal.  The  complex  of  terminals  and  the  freight  village  (Interporto)  in  Novara  will  benefit  from  the  rail  traffic  increase  generated  by  the  opening  of  the  new  Gotthard  Base  Tunnel.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  project  involves  the  expansion  of  the  capacity  and  the  rail  accessibility  of  the  West  terminal  in  order  to  remove  the  current  technical  bottlenecks  hindering  the  development  of  intermodal  traffic.  This  will  be  achieved  via  the  installation  of  a  600  metre  long  track,  revamping  and  increase  of  the  intermodal  yard  and  the  installation  of  fixed  equipment  for  transhipment.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Completion  of  the  project  will  result  in  increased  hourly  handling  capacity  at  the  terminal,  halved  waiting  time  for  trucks  and  a  decrease  by  40%  of  the  turnaround  time  for  inbound/outbound  trains.</p>

<p><br>The  Northern  Corridor  is  an  east-west  motorway  which  will  cross  the  old  historic  town  centre  of  Riga  for  a  total  length  of  30  km.  In  the  east  it  will  join  the  Freeport  of  Riga  and  the  E67   "Via  Baltica "  motorway,  while  in  the  west  it  will  connect  the  Riga  bypass  and,  ultimately,  the  E22  motorway.</p>

The  projects  will  improve  the  safety  of  rail  transport  whilst  at  the  same  time  making  the  sector  more  competitive.</strong></em></p> 
<p><br>The  two  projects  were  selected  under  the  2012  TEN-T  Multi-Annual  Call,  which  gave  priority  to  ERTMS,  a  major  European  industrial  initiative  to  make  rail  transport  safer  and  more  competitive.  Its  goal  is  to  substitute  more  than  20  different  train  control-command  systems  which  are  currently  in  use  in  Europe  with  a  single  harmonised  system.</p> 
<p><br>The  first,  receiving  a  grant  of  just  over  €1.4  million,  involves  upgrading  the  ERTMS  software  and  hardware  of  the  onboard  units  of  12  high  speed  locomotives  in  order  to  ensure  their  compliance  with  the  latest  consolidated  version  of  this  system.  The  locomotives  will  then  be  able  to  circulate  in  all  other  EU  Member  States  which  have  implemented  the  same  system.</p> 
<p><br>The  second  project,  which  will  receive  €3  million  in  EU  co-financing,  consists  of  deploying  ERTMS  trackside  equipment  along  the  Torino-Napoli  high  speed  line,  more  specifically  on  the  230  km  long  Roma-Napoli  section,  which  is  part  of  ERTMS  Corridor  B,  which  stretches  in  a  north  to  south  direction  from  Stockholm  in  Sweden  to  Naples  in  Italy.  The  project  will  ensure  the  full  interoperability  of  the  line.</p>

<p><br>It  specifically  concerns  retrofitting  13  locomotives  belonging  to  four  private  railway  undertakings  from  Austria  and  Slovenia.  The  locomotives  will  then  be  able  to  operate  on  the  ERTMS  (level  1  and  2)  lines  of  Austria,  Germany,  Hungary,  Slovenia,  the  Czech  Republic,  Slovakia  and  Switzerland.<br><br>By  increasing  the  interoperability  of  the  locomotives,  the  project  will  enhance  the  competitiveness  of  the  rail  freight  sector.</p> 
<p><br>The  project  will  be  monitored  by  the  Innovation  and  Networks  Executive  Agency  (INEA)  and  is  set  to  be  completed  by  the  end  of  2015.</p>

This  is  particularly  relevant  for  the  environmentally  sensitive  Alpine  region  where  road  traffic  is  at  the  origin  of  important  effects  on  the  environment.</p>

<p><br>The  project,  selected  for  funding  under  the  2012  TEN-T  Annual  Programme,  consists  of  modernisation  works  to  five  main  locks  located  in  Le  Coudray,  Vive-Eaux,  La  Cave,  Varennes  and  Evry  (currently  not  in  operation),  with  the  objective  to  increase  their  availability  and  reliability.</p> 
<p><br>The  works  will  consist  of  upgrading  the  different  structural  parts  of  the  locks,  such  as  their  sluice  chambers,  aqueducts,  hydraulic  units  and  electrical  cabinets,  piers  and  control  rooms.</p> 
<p><br>As  a  result,  the  existing  bottleneck  in  inland  navigation  of  the  Haute  Seine  will  be  overcome  and  its  accessibility  will  be  improved,  which  will  boost  intermodality  and  increase  the  competitiveness  of  inland  waterways  as  a  whole.</p>

The  studies,  which  will  pave  the  way  for  the  works,  contribute  to  the  realisation  of  the  “Railway  axis  Fehmarn  belt”  (<a  id= "PAGE112470000000635 "  title= "Priority  Project  20 "  href= "javascript:void(0); ">TEN-T  Priority  Project  20</a>).</strong></em></p> 
<p><br>The  first  study,  selected  for  just  over  €30  million  of  funding  under  the  2012  TEN-T  Multi-Annual  Call,  involves  a  new  high  speed  railway  section  between  Copenhagen  and  Ringsted.  The  existing  line  that  runs  via  Roskilde  is  one  of  Denmark's  most  heavily  used  and  strategically  important  routes,  both  for  commuter  traffic  to/from  Copenhagen  as  well  as  for  freight  traffic.</p> 
<p><br>In  2012  a  new  dual  track  line  from  Copenhagen  to  Ringsted  via  Køge  was  proposed,  including  a  new  station  in  the  northern  part  of  Køge  (Køge  Nord)  and  a  maximum  speed  for  passenger  trains  of  250  km/h.  The  study  will  specifically  concentrate  on  the  project  management,  detailed  design  for  construction  work  and  tender  packages  of  this  section.</p> 
<p><br>The  second  study,  also  supported  by  the  TEN-T  Multi-Annual  Programme,  receives  €19.7  million  to  help  look  at  solutions  to  increase  the  capacity  of  the  Ringsted-Rødby  section  that  connects  to  the  Fehmarn  Belt.  Specifically,  this  study  will  look  at  project  management,  detailed  design  for  the  construction  works  as  well  as  its  tendering  and  awarding.</p> 
<p><br>The  studies  and  their  results  are  expected  to  produce  a  significant  impact  on  local  planning  and  give  a  boost  to  the  economy  and  the  overall  transport  efficiency  of  the  entire  Baltic  sea  region.</p>

"112470111935571","1403186330","Greener  river  vessel  inaugurated  today  thanks  to  EU  support","LNG  takes  a  step  forward","/images/news/news_tent.png","<p><em><strong>The  Innovation  and  Networks  Executive  Agency  (INEA)  is  pleased  to  announce  the  inauguration  of  the  “Eiger-Nordwand”,  the  first  inland  waterway  vessel  to  be  retrofitted  with  pollution-reducing  Liquefied  Natural  Gas  (LNG)  engines.  This  pilot  vessel  represents  one  of  the  milestones  of  the  EU-supported  “LNG  Masterplan  Rhine-Main-Danube”  project,  which  is  a  series  of  studies  and  trials  to  assess  the  use  of  Liquefied  Natural  Gas  (LNG)  as  a  shipping  fuel  in  the  European  inland  waterway  sector.  It  is  a  great  technical  accomplishment  that  paves  the  way  for  more  clean  fuels  to  be  deployed  on  the  entire  transport  supply  chain  along  the  inland  waterway  networks.</strong></em></p> 
<p><br>INEA  Executive  Director  Dirk  Beckers  praised  today’s  inauguration,  noting:  “This  is  only  a  start.  The  LNG  Masterplan  is  a  prime  example  of  the  opportunities  we  have  ahead  to  develop  new  technologies  and  new  fuels,  and  I  am  confident  that  this  project  will  continue  to  deliver  benefits  to  inland  waterways  by  analysing  and  testing  all  aspects  related  to  LNG  deployment.  LNG  is  rapidly  emerging  as  a  more  environmentally  friendly  fuel  for  the  shipping  sector  and  its  uptake  is  strongly  encouraged  by  the  European  Union.”</p> 
<p><br>The  inauguration  of  the  Eiger-Nordwand  is  a  key  step  in  the  realisation  of  the  “LNG  Masterplan”  project,  one  of  the  biggest  innovation  projects  financed  through  the  TEN-T  programme,  which  was  selected  for  funding  under  the  2012  TEN-T  Multi-Annual  Call.  It  benefits  from  over  €40  million  of  EU  support  and  is  implemented  by  a  consortium  of  33  companies  and  organisations  from  the  public  and  private  sectors  across12  EU  Member  States*.</p> 
<p><br>The  “LNG  Masterplan”  consists  of  a  series  of  studies  and  pilot  deployments  for  LNG  as  fuel  for  inland  vessels,  as  well  as  cargo  transported  on  waterways  and  distributed  via  inland  ports  along  the  Rhine,  Main  and  Danube  rivers.  The  objective  is  to  provide  a  platform  for  key  public  and  private  stakeholders  to  promote  LNG  uptake  in  the  inland  waterway  sector  and  build  the  necessary  regulatory  framework  for  the  safe  transport  and  use  of  LNG  as  vessel  fuel.</p> 
<p><br>As  part  of  the  project,  a  series  of  inland  waterway  vessels  will  be  retrofitted  with  LNG  engines  capable  of  substantially  decreasing  nitrogen  oxides  (NOx)  and  particulate  emissions,  the  main  pollutants  from  inland  waterway  transport,  as  well  as  improving  local  air  quality  alongside  waterways  and  ports.

The  52  projects  selected  from  the  2013  Multi-Annual  Call  and  the  54  from  the  2013  Annual  Call  will  use  the  EU’s  financial  support  to  bring  forward  the  completion  of  the  TEN-T  network  as  well  as  studying  innovative  ways  of  reducing  the  transport  sector’s  carbon  footprint.</p> 
<p><br>European  Commission  Vice-President  Siim  Kallas,  responsible  for  transport,  noted:  <em> "I  am  very  happy  to  see  that  over  one  hundred  new  projects  will  take  off  thanks  to  EU  financial  support  under  the  2013  TEN-T  Calls.

</ul> 
<p>The  2013  Annual  Programme  Call  gives  financing  for  a  similar  number  of  projects  (54  in  total)  covering  the  different  modes  of  transport,  but  also  focusing  on  the  decarbonisation  of  transport.  This  Call  grants  €90.7  million  in  total  funding  in  two  main  priority  areas:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Priority  1</strong>  –  Studies  concerning  the  acceleration/facilitation  of  the  implementation  of  TEN-T  projects  -  27  projects  selected,  €27.03  million  in  funding</li> 
<li><strong>Priority  2</strong>  -  Measures  to  promote  innovation  and  new  technologies  for  transport  infrastructure  and  facilities  contributing  to  decarbonisation  or  the  reduction  of  the  external  costs  in  general  -  27  projects  selected,  €63.66  million  in  funding</li>

This  is  the  largest  ever  single  amount  of  EU  funding  earmarked  for  transport  infrastructure.  Applicants  have  until  26th  February  2015  to  submit  their  bids.</strong></em></p> 
<p><br>The  funding  will  be  concentrated  along  9  major  transport  corridors  which,  taken  together,  will  form  a  core  transport  network  and  act  as  the  economic  life-blood  of  the  Single  Market  (see  map  attached).  The  funding  will  remove  bottlenecks,  revolutionise  East  West  connections  and  streamline  cross  border  transport  operations  for  businesses  and  citizens  throughout  the  EU. </p> 
<p><br>Commission  Vice  President  Siim  Kallas,  responsible  for  transport,  commented:   "Transport  is  fundamental  to  an  efficient  European  economy,  so  investing  in  transport  connections  to  fuel  the  economic  recovery  is  more  important  than  ever.  Areas  of  Europe  without  good  transport  connections  are  not  going  to  grow  or  prosper.  Member  States  need  to  seize  this  opportunity  to  bid  for  funding  to  be  better  connected,  more  competitive  and  provide  smoother  and  quicker  journeys  for  citizens  and  businesses. "</p> 
<p><br>EU  financing  for  transport  has  tripled  to  €26  billion  for  the  period  2014-2020  (compared  to  €8  billion  for  2007-2013),  under  the  new  <a  id= "PAGE112470008039489 "  title= "Connecting  Europe  Facility "  href= "javascript:void(0); ">Connecting  Europe  Facility  (CEF)</a>.  This  is  the  first  tranche  of  the  new  funding  for  transport  to  be  made  available.</p> 
<p><br>Taken  together  these  innovations  -  the  tripling  of  transport  financing  combined  with  the  decision  to  tightly  focus  the  funding  along  <a  href= "http://ec.europa.eu/transport/themes/infrastructure/ten-t-guidelines/corridors/index_en.htm "  target= "_blank ">9  major  EU  transport  corridors</a>  -  amounts  to  the  most  radical  overhaul  of  EU  transport  infrastructure  policy  since  its  inception  in  the  1980s.</p> 
<p><br>The  new  core  network,  to  be  established  by  2030,  will  connect:</p>

<li>38  key  airports  with  rail  connections  into  major  cities</li> 
<li>15,000  km  of  railway  line  upgraded  to  high  speed</li> 
<li>35  cross  border  projects  to  reduce  bottlenecks</li>

Benefitting  from  over  €40  million  of  EU  support  and  implemented  by  a  consortium  of  33  companies  and  organisations  from  the  public  and  private  sectors  across  12  EU  Member  States*  the  “LNG  Masterplan”  consists  of  a  series  of  studies  and  pilot  deployments  for  LNG  as  fuel  for  inland  vessels,  as  well  as  cargo  transported  on  waterways  and  distributed  via  inland  ports  along  the  Rhine,  Main  and  Danube  rivers.  The  objective  is  to  provide  a  platform  for  key  public  and  private  stakeholders  to  promote  LNG  uptake  in  the  inland  waterway  sector  and  build  the  necessary  regulatory  framework  for  the  safe  transport  and  use  of  LNG  as  vessel  fuel.</p> 
<p><br>Besides  commissioning  the  Sirocco,  the  project  is  also  supporting  the  switch  from  traditional  engines  to  LNG  ones  capable  of  substantially  decreasing  nitrogen  oxides  (NOx)  and  particulate  emissions  –  the  main  pollutants  from  inland  waterway  transport  –  as  well  as  improving  local  air  quality  alongside  waterways  and  ports.  This  is  a  win-win  situation  for  business  and  society  and  improves  the  environmental  performance  of  the  inland  waterway  sector  as  a  whole  whilst  decarbonising  the  entire  transport  supply  chain.</p> 
<p><br>The  results  of  the  “LNG  Masterplan”  project,  due  by  December  2015,  are  expected  to  have  a  significant  impact  on  LNG’s  introduction  on  the  European  inland  waterway  networks  and  to  promote  this  means  of  transport  in  general.</p>

<p> </p> 
<p>The  capacity  of  the  Caland  Bridge  connecting  the  Port  of  Rotterdam  to  the  main  European  rail  network  needs  a  boost  to  cope  with  the  increasing  freight  transport  demand.  It  is  currently  considered  to  be  the  main  bottleneck  on  the  Dutch  part  of  the  rail  freight  corridors  connecting  Rotterdam  to  Germany,  Poland,  the  Scandinavian  countries  and  southern  Europe.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>This  project  will  carry  out  the  studies  (route  selection,  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  and  draft  route  decision)  looking  at  relieving  the  traffic  to  and  from  the  port.

<p>Hopper  barges  carrying  sand  dredged  from  ports  are  most  often  using  conventional,  more  polluting  fuel  than  accepted  by  the  European  regulation  for  future  shipping  services  (2050  onwards).  This  project  is  addressing  the  European  requirements  to  reduce  maritime  transport  emissions  by  constructing  an  LNG-powered  hopper  barge  in  the  ports  of  Bremerhaven  and  Bremen  in  Germany.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  pilot  project  features  the  technical  design  of  the  new  barge,  granting  permissions  to  operate  in  the  inland  waterways  of  the  port  areas,  as  well  as  actual  construction  and  testing  of  the  barge  under  real  life  conditions.

The  new  bridge  connecting  Zealand/Masnedø  and  Falster  is  to</em></strong>  <strong><em>improve  rail  links  between  Scandinavia  and  Central  Europe.</em></strong></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  current  Storstrøm  Bridge  built  in  1937  is  in  a  poor  state,  and  its  full  repair  is  not  feasible.  Moreover,  the  bridge's  single-track  rail  line  is  not  up  to  today's  demand  for  passenger  and  freight  transport.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>This  project  will  carry  out  studies  on  the  Environmental  Impact  Assessment,  conceptual  design  and  preparation  of  the  construction  act  for  a  new,  3.9  km  double-track  rail  and  road  bridge.  The  new  bridge  will  increase  the  rail  transport  capacity  on  the  line  linking  Zealand  and  the  Falster  islands  and  improve  the  overall  rail  capacity  between  Scandinavia  and  Central  Europe.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>This  project  is  part  of  a  larger  rail  infrastructure  development  plan  aiming  at  the  removal  of  a  bottleneck  in  the  medium-term  range  by  improving  the  capacity  of  the  railway  line  between  the  Øresund  fixed  link  and  Hamburg/Bremen/Hannover  (Priority  Project  20).  Once  completed,  the  larger  project  is  planned  to  accommodate  more  than  40,000  trains  annually  -  equal  to  more  than  100  trains  a  day.  In  addition  to  creating  a  significantly  improved  railway  axis  between  Central  Europe  and  Scandinavia,  the  project  will  relieve  congestion  on  the  Great  Belt  route  across  Denmark  via  Funen  and  Jutland  to  North  Germany,  particularly  on  the  rail  network.</p>

<p> </p> 
<p>European  air  traffic  management  (ATM)  is  built  on  different  national  systems  that  are  not  always  interoperable  for  seamless  ground-to-ground  and  air-to-ground  communications.  Moreover,  some  ATM  services  need  an  upgrade  to  faster,  safer,  more  efficient  and  reliable  technologies  to  cope  with  the  increasing  number  of  flights.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>European  air  navigation  service  providers  have  joined  forces  to  prepare  the  grounds  for  the  future  European  air  traffic  management  system.  They  will  address  in  particular  two  major  ATM  communication  infrastructures:  the  next  generation  of  pan-European  network  services  enabling  the  exchange  of  air  traffic  information  and  the  data  link  services  improving  communication  between  the  pilot  and  the  control  tower  with  digitalised  computer  messages.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  aim  of  this  study  is  to  analyse  the  technical  and  business  needs  of  both  communication  infrastructures  to  ensure  high-quality  and  efficient  services  ultimately  leading  to  safer  and  'greener'  air  traffic  in  Europe.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  project  involves  members  of  A6  alliance,  a  group  of  air  navigation  service  providers  from  Germany,  Spain,  France,  Italy,  Sweden  and  the  UK,  which  together  represent  more  than  70%  of  the  European  air  traffic.   Key  industry  stakeholders  in  the  field  will  be  consulted  by  the  study  team.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  study  is  expected  to  make  a  fundamental  contribution  to  the  Single  European  Sky  initiative  (<a  href= "http://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/air/single_european_sky/index_en.htm ">SES</a>),  which  aims  to  increase  Europe's  airspace  capacity,  reduce  the  risk  of  accidents  and  the  environmental  impact  of  flights  and  cut  the  costs  for  passengers.</p>

<p> </p> 
<p>European  Regulations  require  the  shipping  sector  to  reduce  marine  sulphur  emissions  in  the  North  Sea  to  0.1%  as  of  January  2015.  One  of  the  ways  to  reach  this  objective  is  to  use  cleaner  fuel  such  as  LNG.  This  project  responds  to  the  TEN-T  programme  goal  to  provide  publicly  accessible  LNG  refuelling  facilities  in  all  core  European  ports  by  2030,  leading  to  improved  market  acceptance  and  availability  of  LNG  as  an  alternative  fuel.</p>

<p>The  project  features  a  study  and  pilot  construction  of  a  flexible,  multi-modal  LNG  terminal  that  could  provide  a  reliable  supply  of  LNG  to  maritime,  road  and  rail  users  in  a  geographical  area  of  around  300-400  km.  It  covers  planning,  design  and  engineering,  as  well  as  the  construction  and  operation  of  an  LNG  filling  station.  While  the  initial  size  will  be  relatively  small  the  flexible  approach  ensures  that  effective  market  demand  can  be  accommodated  by  enlarging  the  facility  at  a  later  stage.</p>

<p>European  Regulations  require  the  shipping  sector  to  reduce  marine  sulphur  emissions  in  the  North  Sea  to  0.1%  as  of  January  2015.  One  of  the  ways  for  the  sector  to  reach  this  goal  is  to  use  cleaner  fuels,  such  as  LNG.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>This  project  is  part  of  a  larger  project  aiming  to  promote  the  use  of  LNG  in  North  Sea  maritime  traffic.  It  will  cover  three  main  objectives,  namely  the:</p> 
<ol> 
<li><span>Installation  of  small  scale  equipment  for  LNG  bunkering  in  the  Zeebrugge  terminal  (Belgium)  to  break  down  large  quantities  of  LNG  into  smaller  ones  for  further  distribution  in  the  North  Sea  and  the  Channel  region.  Zeebrugge  would  become  the  first  European  terminal  open  to  the  public  for  this  kind  of  operation.</span></li> 
<li><span>Equipment  of  three  ferry  berths  with  automatic  quick  release  mooring  hooks,  two  at  the  ports  of  Portsmouth  (UK)  and  one  in  Caen/Ouistreham  (France).</span></li> 
<li><span>Establishment  of  an  optimal  logistic  chain  to  LNG  in  order  to  deliver  LNG  to  ports  and  ships  remote  from  the  main  European  gas  import  terminals  and  therefore  encourage  the  rapid  growth  in  the  number  of  vessels  using  LNG.</span></li> 
</ol> 
<p>The  project  was  selected  for  EU  funding  with  the  assistance  of  external  experts  under  the  <a  href= "/en/ten-t/apply_for_funding/follow_the_funding_process/2013_map_air_traffic_management_call.htm ">TEN-T  Multi-Annual  Call  2013</a>,  priority  'Motorways  of  the  Sea'.

<p>European  Regulations  require  the  shipping  sector  to  reduce  marine  sulphur  emissions  in  the  North  Sea  to  0.1%  as  of  January  2015.  One  of  the  ways  for  the  sector  to  reach  this  goal  is  to  use  cleaner  fuels,  such  as  LNG.  The  TEN-T  programme  puts  forward  the  obligation  to  provide  publicly  accessible  LNG  refuelling  facilities  in  all  core  European  ports  by  2030.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>As  the  first  such  initiative  in  Denmark  and  one  of  the  first  in  Europe,  this  project  will  develop  a  200  tonne/500  m3  pilot  LNG  storage  tank  and  bunkering  facility,  with  the  perspective  to  develop  it  into  a  larger  one  of  3000-5000  m3.  The  new  facilities  will  provide  LNG  for  ships  both  within  and  outside  the  EU,  as  well  as  regional  consumers  including  road  transport.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  project's  outcomes  are  expected  to  serve  as  best  practice  to  other  ports  in  northern  Europe  and  encourage  consumers  switch  to  alternative  fuel  with  reduced  environmental  impact.  It  will  also  be  the  first  step  towards  creating  a  robust  LNG  supply  infrastructure  in  the  region.</p>

<p> </p> 
<p>European  regulation  requires  all  cargo  vessels  travelling  in  European  waters  to  cut  down  the  emission  of  sulphur  oxide  (SO)  from  2015  onwards,  to  decrease  environmental  pollution.  Among  the  existing  solutions  scrubber,  a  system  removing  SO  from  exhaust  gases  with  fresh  water,  is  the  most  common  technology  used  in  this  process.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>This  pilot  project  will  install  and  test  the  latest  scrubber  technology  that  uses  sea  water  instead  of  fresh  water  in  an  open  loop.  The  new  cleaning  system  is  expected  to  bring  a  number  of  economic  and  environmental  benefits:  ships  will  no  longer  need  to  carry  supplies  of  fresh  water,  nor  will  they  have  to  transport  and  use  chemicals  for  water  treatment,  in  order  to  reuse  it.  More  space  will  be  available  for  cargo.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  latest  scrubber  technology  will  be  tried  out  on  three  different  types  of  cargo  ships,  which  all  together  represent  the  most  common  general  cargo  vessels  in  the  water  trade  routes  of  the  North  and  Baltic  Sea.  Project's  results  will  be  shared  with  stakeholders  of  the  transport  industry  and  decision  makers,  and  could  facilitate  introduction  of  the  technology  at  EU  level,  enhancing  the  competitiveness  of  short  sea  transport  compared  to  other  modes.</p>

An  indicative  amount  of  €100  million  will  be  made  available  for  projects  which  will  contribute  to  ending  energy  isolation,  to  eliminating  energy  bottlenecks  and  to  the  completion  of  the  internal  energy  market.   The  money  will  act  as  a  catalyst  for  securing  additional  financing  by  private  and  public  investors.  With  a  total  of  €650  million  for  grants  foreseen  in  2015,  this  is  only  the  first  of  two  calls  planned  for  2015.The  deadline  to  submit  applications  is  29  April.  A  decision  on  the  selection  of  proposals  to  be  funded  is  expected  for  mid-July.</p> 
<p><br><a  href= "http://ec.europa.eu/commission/2014-2019/arias-canete_en "  target= "_blank ">EU  Commissioner  for  Climate  Action  and  Energy  Miguel  Arias  Cañete</a>  said:   "Reliable  and  well-connected  energy  networks  are  vital  for  achieving  a  resilient  European  Energy  Union.  We  need  major  investments  to  make  our  energy  grid  fit  for  the  future.  This  funding  opportunity  will  help  build  a  competitive,  sustainable  and  secure  energy  market,  and  ultimately  bring  the  benefits  into  our  homes  and  businesses. "</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>In  order  to  apply  for  a  grant,  a  project  has  to  be  on  the  list  of  'projects  of  common  interest'.  A   first  list  was  adopted  by  the  European  Commission  in  October  2013.  It  consists  of  248  key  energy  infrastructure  projects  which,  when  completed,  would  each  ensure  significant  benefits  for  at  least  two  Member  States,  enhance  security  of  supply,  contribute  to  market  integration,  increased  competition  as  well  as  to  sustainability.  The  list  will  be  updated  at  the  end  of  this  year.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>EU  financing  for  energy  infrastructure  under  the  CEF  is  €5.85  billion  for  the  period  2014-2020.  The  bulk  of  this  money  will  go  to  grants,  whereas  a  part  of  this  amount  will  be  dedicated  to  setting  up  financial  instruments  for  infrastructure  development,  including  a  contribution  to  the  European  Fund  for  Strategic  Investments.  These  grants  will  contribute  to  carrying  out  both  studies  and  works.  However,  proposals  for  works  can  only  receive  grants  if  the  project  will  deliver  significant  benefits  in  a  macro-regional  context,  such  as  security  of  supply,  solidarity  between  Member  States  or  innovation,  and  is  at  the  same  time  not  commercially  viable.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>In  general,  the  amount  of  EU  support  cannot  exceed  50%  of  the  eligible  costs  for  both  studies  and  works.  In  exceptional  cases,  when  a  project  contributes  significantly  to  the  security  of  supply,  enhances  energy  solidarity  between  Member  States  or  offers  highly  innovative  solutions,  EU  support  may  be  increased  to  a  maximum  of  75%  of  the  costs  for  works.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>On  16  March  the  <a  href= "http://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/infrastructure "  target= "_blank ">European  Commission's  Directorate-General  for  Energy</a>,  together  with  INEA,  will  organise  an  <a  id= "PAGE112470114570723 "  title= "2015  CEF  Energy  Info  Day "  href= "javascript:void(0); ">Info  Day</a>  in  Brussels  to  give  project  promoters  more  information  about  the  funding  opportunities,  including  practical  details  about  how  to  apply  for  a  CEF  grant. </p>

<p> </p> 
<p>The  European  project  consortium  led  by  <a  href= "http://www.fundacion.valenciaport.com/ ">Valenciaport  Foundation</a>  plans  to  pilot  nine  real-life  trials  of  last  generation  port  container  machinery  and  energy  management  systems  to  reduce  pollutant  carbon  emissions  and  to  increase  the  energy  efficiency  in  both  ports.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Specifically,  the  two  year-long  initiative  will  focus  on  implementing  a  smart  energy  management  system  including  dynamic  (on-demand)  lighting  for  the  whole  container  terminal  and  on  adapting  equipment  such  as  cranes  and  tractors  to  alternative  fuels  LNG  and  electricity.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  new  system  is  expected<span  lang= "EN-US ">  to  reduce  significantly  the  current  energy  consumption  in  the  port  container  terminals.  For  example,  the</span><span  lang= "EN-US ">  piloted  crane</span><span  lang= "EN-US ">  could  use  up  to  50%  less  fuel  than  a  standard  full  diesel  crane,  and  the  </span><span  lang= "EN-US ">dynamic  lighting</span><span  lang= "EN-US ">  could  reduce  the  </span><span  lang= "EN-US ">energy  consumption  at  the  port  </span><span  lang= "EN-US ">by  </span><span  lang= "EN-US ">30%</span><span  lang= "EN-US ">.</span></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  pilot  results  will  be  made  public  in  five  communication  events  organised  throughout  the  duration  of  the  project.  In  addition,  standards  and  policy  recommendations  based  on  the  project  results  will  be  defined  to  encourage  the  adoption  of  these  technologies  by  a  critical  mass  of  port  container  terminals  in  the  EU.</p>

<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Road  hauliers  carrying  goods  often  travel  one  way  with  empty  containers.  Managing  better  the  truck  schedule,  especially  for  SMEs,  to  match  freight  journeys  would  most  likely  lead  to  cuts  in  freight  operating  costs,  fuel  usage,  and  ultimately  carbon  emissions.  It  will  also  contribute  in  reducing  traffic  in  port  congested  areas.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  aim  of  this  project  is  to  test  Boxreload,  an  IT  freight  tool,  on  competing  hauliers  operating  in  the  Rotterdam  area.  The  tool's  effectiveness  will  be  assessed  in  terms  of  business  sustainability,  empty  journeys  and  CO2  emissions  saved,  and  the  results  will  be  widely  shared  in  the  transport  industry. </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Previous  studies  have  already  demonstrated  that  the  solution  works  from  a  technical  perspective  and  has  business  benefits.  A  pilot  deployment  is  now  required  to  further  define  the  solution,  demonstrate  its  commercial  viability  on  a  larger  scale  and  facilitate  deployment  in  other  locations.</p>

<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  depth  of  Lake  Ijssel  (Ijsselmeer),  the  largest  lake  in  the  Netherlands,  is  not  sufficient  for  container  vessels  and  coasters  to  pass  through,  and  the  Lorentz  Locks  controlling  the  entry  to  the  lake  through  the  Afsluitdijk  are  too  small  to  allow  large  ships  to  pass  through.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Making  large  vessel  transport  possible  through  Lake  Ijssel  would  improve  the  connections  between  the  North  Sea  and  the  northern  Dutch  inland  waterway  network  -  in  particular  the  inland  ports  of  Kampen,  Zwolle  and  Meppel.  Better  connections  would  in  turn  lead  to  an  increase  in  intermodal  transport  and  a  larger  share  of  more  sustainable  transport  modes.</p>

<p> </p> 
<p>European  air  navigation  service  providers  are  currently  using  different  ATM  systems  which  were  developed  based  on  national  requirements.

<p>This  project  brings  together  French  air  navigation  service  provider  and  several  members  of  COOPANS  alliance  (the  service  providers  in  Austria,  Denmark,  Ireland  and  Sweden)  to  set  up  solid  foundations  for  the  convergence  of  their  respective  ATM  systems  towards  a  common  technical  platform  by  2025.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The  common  ATM  system  will  allow  remarkable  savings  through  a  progressive  harmonisation  of  the  existing  infrastructures,  sharing  costs  for  new  functionalities,  technical  operating  procedures,  training,  maintenance  and  development,  and  ultimately  reduce  the  flight  costs  for  passengers.   </p>
